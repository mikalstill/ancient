inetd:
	- will shut down services respawning too fast. Should bring them 
	  up again after a few minutes. (It should. If it actually doesn't,
	  please advise.
        - should warn if daemons exit with fatal signals. (Does now.)
	- If you switch a service to vhosting, you have to kill -1 twice.
	  This is because it adds the new services in (and thus tries to
	  bind the sockets) before it flushes the old ones, so the binds
	  fail the first time.
	- setproctitle() will produce a "might be used uninitialized"
	  warning

ping:
	- lets any user view arbitrary incoming icmp traffic.
