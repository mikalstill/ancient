 <bio>Michael has been working in the image processing field for several
years, including a couple of years managing and developing large image
databases for an Australian government department. He currently works for
TOWER Software, which manufactures a world-leading EDMS and Records
Management package named TRIM. Michael is also the developer of Panda, an
open-source PDF generation API, as well as a bunch of other Open Source
code.</bio>

 <abstract>There's nothing quite like command-line tools for handling large batches of tasks, and image manipulations are no exception. Web developers and administrators will appreciate the ability to handle large numbers of files easily, either at the command line or in scripts. Programmer Michael Still presents more examples of the ImageMagick suite, this time demonstrating how to put cool curved corners on your images, a variety of different frames and borders, converting to and from Adobe's PDF format, and how to extract all the images from multiple page file formats.

 <li> ImageMagick is a collection of tools and libraries to read, write, 
and manipulate images in over 89 major formats. 
The <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org">ImageMagick</a> Web site is
an excellent resource, and offers downloads of the ImageMagick source
code. 
The <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/www/utilities.html">Command-line
utilities</a> page gives more information on convert, mogrify, 
composite and other tools like compare and conjure, as well as 
their options -- it also gives a complete list of the 
file formats that are recognized by ImageMagick. </li>

<li>
You can also invoke ImageMagick capabilities from your favorite 
programming language, from C and Java to Perl and PHP. Check the list 
of <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/www/apis.html">programming 
interfaces</a> for more information.
