- introduce hexdump option (-x) to dump register values in addition to decoding.

- Identify Transmeta CPUs.

- Decode mtrr registers as well as dumping them

- Dump cyrix ARR registers when we pass --mtrr

- --apic
  Dump APIC registers

- --bugs to print known CPU errata
  "Stepping D0 Duron detected with Cache size bug."

- --gcc option to output best optimisation parameters
  for that CPU.

- Some CPUs allow the name string to be changed.
  If this has happened we die horribly. We need to store the current
  name string, perform the cpuid reset sequence, and restore the
  name string on exit.

- cpuid macro might cut down huge switch statements in a few places

- After identifying CPU we can associate more info with the CPU.
  - CPU codename
  - Introduction date
  - number of transistors
  - voltages (I/O, Core, Maximum)

- review code for extended natsemi support.

- report L3 (chipset) caches (requires PCI poking)

- might be time to start thinking about XML for CPU descriptions?

- libx86info for other apps
