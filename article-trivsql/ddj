Hi Michael,
Thanks for your interest in Dr. Dobb's Journal. Yes, this does sound like a
very interesting and appropriate article for DDJ. Can you please send me a
short outline describing the article you have in mind. The outline should
reflect an article that's about 2000-2500 words in length (not counting, code,
figures, tables, etc). Also, be sure to identify what problems your embedded
database engine solves. Looking forward to hearing from you.
Regards,
Jon Erickson

Michael,
My apologies for not responding sooner. Time just slipped away. Yes, you're right
on all counts. This does sound like an interesting projects that DDJ readers would
take to. And yes, embedded databases seem of great interest right now. We do have
one or two in the works, but I do like your's and we'll find a home for it. Can
you proceed, keeping the text of the article to under 2500 words (not counting
code, figures, tables, etc). Length is important now, since space is tight. Are
there any questions I can answer at this time?

Michael,
Thanks for your follow up. Go ahead and send in the article at your earliest
convenience. It will fit in just about any issue where we have space. As for fee, we can
pay $750 for the article.
Have a good weekend.
