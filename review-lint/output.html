>It also did more than that for me. Any book that in explaining how to use a tool like lint feels that it needs to explain the history of Unix, including diagrams, is trying to tell me something. Lint seems to have a chequered past, with some releases of the <SPAN

>There are some other catches, apart from ancient history, in working with a book which is so old. Firstly, I tried to find a lint package for my trusty Debian laptop. There isn't one that I can find &mdash; the closest I could get was a lint-like package called splint. A quick Google confirmed that there didn't seem to be any other freely available lint implementations for C code floating around.</P

>"Splint is a tool for statically checking C programs for security vulnerabilities and coding mistakes. With minimal effort, Splint can be used as a better lint. If additional effort is invested adding annotations to programs, Splint can perform stronger checking than can be done by any standard lint."</SPAN

> are relevant to modern programmers? Well, the historical aspects are certainly interesting, but not going to make me a better programmer. The commentary of how VAXen have different sizes for basic data types certainly made me think about portability, but sizeof() is a pretty standard thing to use these days. The discussion of command line arguements and how they are implemented across a variety of Unix vendors, isn't really going to help me. The examples of common lint error messages and how to fix them is certainly worth thinking about, but don't map to the messages produced by splint.</P
