<p>Linus Torvalds announced <a
href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.5/ChangeLog-2.5.40">2.5.40</a>
and said:</p>

<quote who="Linus Torvalds">

<p>Merges with all the regular suspects - Al's partitioning, Andrew on VM,
USB, networking, sparc, net drivers. And Ingo has been working on fixing 
up the inevitable details in the thread signal stuff, as well as updating   
the smp-scalable timer code.</p>

<p>And ISDN, kbuild, ARM, uml...</p>

<p>And a small reminder that we're now officially in the last month of
features, and since I'm going to be away basically the last week of   
October, so I actually personally consider Oct 20th to be the drop-date,
unless you've got a really good and scary costume.. So don't try to leave
it to the last day.</p>

<p>[ And if that didn't worry you, the following should: I'm perfectly happy
  with the kernel, and as such whatever features _you_ think are missing
  might just not weigh too much with me if you then also make the mistake
  of trying to leave them for the last crunch. I might just take the last
  day off too ;]</p>

<p>And if it wasn't clear to the non-2.5-development people out there, yes
you _should_ also test this code out even before the freeze. The IDE layer
shouldn't be all that scary any more, and while there are still silly
things like trivially non-compiling setups etc, it's generally a good idea  
to try things out as widely as possible before it's getting too late to
complain about things..</p>

</quote>

<p>There was no general outcry against the shorter cut-off date, but Hans
Reiser did say, <quote who="Hans Reiser">Wouldn't it make more sense, or
at least be more fair, to move the deadline in the other direction if you
are going on vacation/away?  We're going to have trouble getting reiser4
ready before the Halloween date you announced, and we are working long
hours as it is.  reiser4 is dramatically better and dramatically faster
than reiserfs.</quote> But there was no reply.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, someone said they'd love to test these heading-toward-stable
kernels, but didn't want to risk trashing their filesystem. They asked how
likely that would be, and Linus replied:</p>

<quote who="Linus Torvalds">

<p>Personal opinion (and only that): not much chance for a filesystem
trashing.</p>

<p>There's more chance of something just not _working_ than of disk
corruption.  Ie you may find that some driver you need doesn't compile
because it hasn't been updated to the new world order yet, for example.</p>

<p>And people still report problems booting, for example, whatever the
reason. So make sure you have a working choice in your lilo
configuration or whatever.</p>

<p>But from what we've seen lately, there really aren't reports of
corrupted disks or anything like that that I've seen.  Which is
obviously not to say that it couldn't happen, but it's not a very likely
occurrence.</p>

<p>That said, I can't set other peoples risk bars for them.</p>

<p>Joe Thornber gave a pointer to a large patch removing LVM from the 2.5
tree.  Alexander Viro applauded this move, saying the LVM code was completely
unmaintained. He added, <quote who="Alexander Viro">Speaking of which, would
Intermezzo maintainers care to port the thing to 2.5?  If it's abandoned -
at least say so ;-/</quote> Andreas Dilger remarked, <quote who="Andreas
Dilger">One of the Clusterfs developers is now working on updating InterMezzo
again...</quote> Elsewhere, someone came back to the LVM question, saying
that some kind of logical volume manager was needed in 2.6, even if LVM1
was removed.  The poster asked, would LVM2 be included? Dave Jones replied,
<quote who="Dave Jones">No-one suggested 2.6.0 shipping without /something/,
but having a dead LVM1 in _2.5_ doesn't help anyone. We've gone 6 months
with it being in a broken/uncompilable state, going another month without
it isn't a big deal. Getting something in before halloween is however a goal
the Sistina folks should be aiming for.</quote></p>

<p>In the course of discussion, the point was made by Jens Axboe and others,
that the replacement for any given feature should be provided <i>before</i>
the patch to remove that feature. As Jens put it, <quote who="Jens Axboe">No
matter the state of lvm, it's much better to day "1, here's the replacement -
2, rip the old one out". What if device mapper for 2.5 really sucks? Maybe
it's so bad that we'd rather fix up lvm1? Apparently davej has patches that
sort-of makes lvm work.  It's not likely, but still :-)</quote> Still, no
one seemed overly concerned that LVM was being removed first. They appeared
more interested in the general point.</p>

<p>Some folks suggested EVMS as a possible replacement, but Alan Cox said
tartly, <quote who="Alan Cox">The more shit you pile the more likely your
compost heap is to collapse.  And with some of the stuff in EVMS I don't want
to be around when it does.</quote> Extolling Device Mapper, he added, <quote
who="Alan Cox">DM is small and clean. It may well be that if we go the DM way
(and I think we should) that those bits of EVMS that we want (like cluster)
actually come out a lot cleaner than in EVMS itself.</quote> But Theodore Ts'o
remarked that one reason DM was so clean was because it lacked a lot of needed
functionality. He said, <quote who="Theodore Ts'o">Last I checked it couldn't
do RAID 5 or r/w snapshots without completely bypassing its core infrastructure
(since you're no longer just doing simple block remapping at that point), and
once you add all that stuff, it's likely to become much more complex.</quote>
But Alan said that there was a perfectly good md driver to handle RAID 5.</p>

<p>Folks continued to advocate for EVMS, and there was much disagreement. One
thing everyone agreed on, however, was the need to get something usable into
2.6; some folks felt such a something could be a temporary expedient, while
others felt (in Alan's words) <quote who="Alan Cox">You don't want a substitute
in the mean time, because then you have to get rid of it.</quote></p>

  title="Linus On Coding Style"
  subject="[patch] Workqueue Abstraction, 2.5.40-H7"
  archive=""
  posts="26"
  startdate="01 Oct 2002 09:24:50 -0700"
  enddate="07 Oct 2002 20:50:26 -0700"
>

<p>In the course of discussing a workqueue abstraction patch, Linus Torvalds
gave some opinions of coding style issues:</p>

<quote who="Linus Torvalds">

<p>Pease don't introduce more typedefs. They only hide what the hell the
thing is, which is actively _bad_ for structures, since passing a structure
by value etc is something that should never be done, for example.</p>

<p>The few saved characters of typing do not actually _buy_ you anything else,
and only obscures what the thing is.</p>

<p>Also, it's against the Linux coding standard, which does not like adding
magic single-letter suffixes to things - that also is the case for your
strange "_s" suffix for a structure (the real suffix is "_struct").</p>

<p>Remember: typing out something is not bad. It's _especially_ not bad if
the typing makes it more clear what the thing is.</p>

</quote>

<p>He added in reply to himself:</p>

<quote who="Linus Torvalds">

<p>Btw, just to avoid counter-examples: Linux does use structures and
typedefs occasionally to hide and force compiler typechecking on small
structures on purpose. We have a few places where we do things like</p>

<pre>        typedef struct {
                unsigned int value;
        } atomic_t;</pre>

<p>(and similar things for the page table entries etc).</p>

<p>This is done because the things are often really regular scalars, but we
use the structure as a strict type checking mechanism. In this case,   
using a typedef is fine, because we don't actually ever want to _access_
it as a structure, and the typedef provices exactly the kind of
information hiding that we need.</p>

<p>But type hiding for a real structure just doesn't make sense, since we  
use it as a true structure, and hiding information just makes it harder
to see.</p>

</quote>

<p>Elsewhere, he added:</p>

<quote who="Linus Torvalds">

<p>Big things should have big names. That's why "u8" is u8, because it's
not just physically small, it also has very little semantics associated
with it.</p>

<p>I want those variable declarations to stand out, and make people understand
that this is not just a variable, it's a structure, and it may be taking up
a noticeable amount of space on the stack, for example.   </p>

<p>That's the main issue for me. I don't personally care so much about trying
to avoid dependencies in the header files that can also be problematic.
That's probably partly because I use fast enough machines that parsing them
a few extra times doesn't much bother me, and circular requirements tend to
be rare enough not to bother me unduly.</p>

<p>So the thing is a big red warning sign that you're now using a complex
data structure, and you should be aware of the semantics that go with it.</p>

  title="NUMA Scheduler Patch"
  subject="[RFC] Simple NUMA scheduler patch"
  archive=""
  posts="10"

  enddate="07 Oct 2002 16:37:24 -0700"

<p>Michael Hohnbaum posted a patch and announced:</p>

<quote who="Michael Hohnbaum">

<p>Attached is a patch which provides a rudimentary NUMA scheduler.
This patch basically does two things:</p>

<p>

<ul>

<li>at exec() it finds the least loaded CPU to assign a task to;</li>

<li>at load_balance() (find_busiest_queue() actually) it favors
  cpus on the same node for taking tasks from.</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>This has been tested on the IA32 based NUMAQ platform and shows
performance gains for kernbench.  Various microbenchmarks also
show improvements and stickiness of processes to nodes.  Profiles
show that the kernbench performance improvements are directly
attributable to the use of local memory caused by tasks running
on the same node through their lifetime.</p>

<p>I will be doing much more testing of this, and likely will be
tweaking some of the algorithms based upon test results.  Any
comments, suggestions, flames are welcome.</p>

<p>Patch applies to 2.5.40 and makes use of the new NUMA topology
API.  This scheduler change should work on other NUMA platforms
with just the definition of the architecture specific macros in
topology.h.</p>

</quote>

<p>Erich Focht replied critically:</p>

<quote who="Erich Focht">

<p>it's a start. But I'm afraid a full solution will need much more code
(which is one of the problems with my NUMA scheduler patch).</p>

<p>The ideas behind your patch are:<br />
1. Do initial load balancing, choose the least loaded CPU at the
beginning of exec().<br />
2. Favor own node for stealing if any CPU on the own node is &gt;25%
more loaded. Otherwise steal from another CPU if that one is &gt;100%
more loaded.</p>

<p>1. is fine but should ideally aim for equal load among nodes. In
the current form I believe that the original load balancer does the
job right after fork() (which must have happened before exec()). As
you changed the original load balancer, you really need this initial
balancing.</p>

<p>2. is ok as it makes it harder to change the node. But again, you don't
aim at equally balanced nodes. And: if the task gets away from the node
on which it got its memory, it has no reason to ever come back to it.</p>

<p>For a final solution I believe that we will need targets like:<br />
(a) equally balance nodes<br />
(b) return tasks to the nodes where their memory is<br />
(c) make nodes "sticky" for tasks which have their memory on them,
"repulsive" for other tasks.<br />
But for a first attempt to get the scheduler more NUMA aware all this
might be just too much.</p>

<p>With simple benchmarks you will most probably beat the plain O(1)
scheduler on NUMA if you implement (a) in just 1. and 2. as your node
is already somewhat "sticky". In complicated benchmarks (like a kernel
compile ;-) it could already be too difficult to understand when the
load balancer did what and why...</p>

<p>It would be nice to see some numbers.</p>

</quote>

<p>Michael agreed that much more was needed for a full solution, but he thought
his patch was a good start that could be extended over time. He argued that
his patch would already produced balanced nodes on a loaded system, though he
agreed with Erich's other points. He added, <quote who="Michael Hohnbaum">I've
got kernbench numbers and profile results from 2.5.38-mm1</quote> [...] <quote
who="Michael Hohnbaum">These show a modest performance benefit, but don't
provide detail on process to node mapping.</quote></p>

<p>The two of them (and others) proceeded to have a polite discussion about
the direction of their respective work, and how best to integrate NUMA
scheduling patches into the kernel.</p>

<p>In the course of discussing possible EVMS inclusion into 2.5, Greg KH
observed:</p>

<quote who="Greg KH">

<p>this is just my opinion of how to use BitKeeper, not the "rule":</p>

<p>You can use BitKeeper for kernel development in two ways:</p>

<p>

<ul>

<li>as a tree to work out of, accepting changes and doing incremental things
all along the way, including merging with the main releases.</li>

<li>or as a way to send changes to a maintainer.</li>

</ul>

</p>

</quote>

<p>Linus Torvalds, close at hand, replied:</p>

<quote who="Linus Torvalds">

<p>I think this is a pretty good point, and is something that I don't think
anybody has ever really said explicitly before.</p>

<p>Some of the BK usage documentation (or "hints") by Jeff clearly imply this
behaviour, but it's not really stated explicitly anywhere.</p>

<p>Also note that using multiple trees is pretty easy - you _can_ easily do
development in the "export" tree, if you just make sure that you only do
one kind of development. And then you have a separate "test" tree that is
a "throw-away combination tree" which just pulls all the other trees and
has the combination of all the different work trees.</p>

<p>That multi-tree approach has advantages quite outside of merging cleanly:
it means that when trouble happens, and something doesn't work, it's
really easy to test out other changes.</p>

<p>I personally often use the multi-tree approach myself when merging bigger
changes (especially if there are other changes that are in the same area):
before I apply something big, I clone my regular tree (often down
to a known version, like the last release), and apply those changes in
that separate tree.</p>

<p>Then I build and test that separate tree before I merge it into my "final 
merge" tree - it makes it easier to see whether problems are due to a
specific line of patches, or whether it might be some interaction between
different changes.</p>

</quote>

<p>He went on:</p>

<quote who="Linus Torvalds">

<p>One reason it's so easy to merge with the USB people (and with Jeff and
David and a number of others too, for that matter) is exactly the fact
that when I get an email that says "pull this tree to get these USB
changes", that is all I get. Not "random support changes to other parts of
the kernel that I also used on my tree".</p>

<p>If I don't get a clean BK tree to pull from, I just cannot pull it. I end
up applying the diffs by hand instead, at which point when I push out my
end result, the original source of the patches does _not_ get a clean BK
tree that matches mine, but instead gets a BK tree that has the changes
TWICE, in addition to all the crud it already had.</p>

<p>Which now makes it doubly hard to see which parts I applied, and which
ones I didn't - BK will usually have successfully merged the trees, but
you don't actually get any real "source control". You only get a messy
tree.</p>

<p>As a result, such a tree is even _less_ useful than it was last time, and
definitely will never be pulled by me ever again, and the poor kernel
developer ends up not getting any of the real advantages of BK at all.</p>

</quote>

<p>He recommended BitKeeper users not only use two BitKeeper trees, but many:</p>

<quote who="Linus Torvalds">

<p>In fact, _most_ people that merge with me using BK seem to use more than
one tree already (some developers are very specialized and only have the
one tree:  JFS and ARM come to mind).</p>

<p>I think it's very much a "getting used to the experience". Some people
don't like it, and that's fine - I have absolutely no problem applying
clean patches either, and some of the major kernel developers have never
used a BK tree to merge with me (Andrew, Viro, Alan, Ingo..) and it hasn't
been a problem.</p>

<p>I personally think there is a very simple rule to using BK: if you're
doing development, and you only have one tree, you're doing something
wrong. The "single tree" approach is fine if your use of BK is really more
of a "anonymous CVS" replacement - you use BK only to track somebody elses
tree and build that. But if you do real development, you should have
multiple trees, or you're not really using BK as a SCM.</p>

<p>Greg KH offered, <quote who="Greg KH">Here's a changeset from Christoph
Hellwig that removes some unneeded code from the kernel core.  This was
leftover from before devfs became part of the main kernel tree, and was trying
to do some naming fixups in kernelspace.  If anyone still has machines using
these names, their startup scripts should be modified to use the "standard"
devfs names.</quote> But Richard Gooch exclaimed:</p>

<quote who="Richard Gooch">

<p>NO! Dammit, you'll break everyone who is using these compact names to
mount the root FS. Look more closely at the code you're trying to
remove, and you'll see it's *not* used to avoid work in startup
scripts. It's only used to create the devfs entry for the root FS.</p>

<p>This change is gratuitous. The code is __init code anyway, so doesn't
contribute to bloat. And forcing people to migrate to the longer names
isn't reasonable, as it chews up precious space on the kernel command
line. I've had times where I ran out of space when I had too many
options.</p>

<p>Linus, please don't apply.</p>

<p>Christoph Hellwig protested that the compact names were never in the
2.5 mainline sources, and that users should use the new devfs names,
plain linux names, or hex values. Richard pointed out that the names had
been in 2.4 for a long time, and removing them would cause lots of users to
experience boot-time kernel panics. Christoph replied, <quote who="Christoph
Hellwig">They have never been the devfs names in_any_ kernel.  Linus made
you change to saner names before merging devfs (saner code would also have
been a good idea, btw..).  Anyway, 2.5 is going to initramfs, so feel free
to put devfsd into your initramfs.</quote> Richard replied:</p>

<quote who="Richard Gooch">

<p>The convenience names for the root FS *have* been in the kernel since
before 2.4.x. I agree with the initramfs approach: that's been my plan
for handling the rootFS compatibility names (put a mini devfsd into 
initramfs). But until all the infrastructure for that is ready, you
can't just go around breaking features people rely on. Especially
where there is no benefit to breaking it.</p>

<p>If you really feel strongly about it, and don't want to wait for
devfsd to be added to initramfs, by all means move the current code
(or the moral equivalent) to initramfs. But you'll have to wait for
initramfs to be available and for it to be the default.</p>

<quote who="Ulrich Drepper">

<p>Now that the Linux kernel is once again able to run all the tests we
have and since glibc 2.3 was released it was time for a new code drop.
I've uploaded the second code drop for the Native POSIX Thread Library:</p>

<p><a
href="ftp://people.redhat.com/drepper/nptl/nptl-0.2.tar.bz2">ftp://people.redhat.com/drepper/nptl/nptl-0.2.tar.bz2</a></p>

<p>You need</p>

<p>

<ul>

<li>the latest of Linus' kernel from BitKeeper (or 2.5.41 when it
  is released);</li>

<li>glibc 2.3</li>

<li>the very latest in tools such as</li>

<ul>

<li>gcc either from the current development branch or the gcc 3.2
    from Red Hat Linux 8;</li>

<li>binutils preferrably from CVS, from H.J. Lu's latest release for
    Linux, or from RHL 8.</li>

</ul>

</ul>

</p>

<p>Compiling glibc should proceed smoothly.  But there are a number of
tests which fail, mostly because some functionality is missing in
glibc.  Ignore those errors.  It is only important that all tests in
nptl/ are passing.  Run</p>

<p>  make subdirs=nptl check</p>

<p>to run all thread tests.</p>

<p>This version features several improvements:</p>

<p>

<ul>

<li>all APIs are now implemented;</li>

<li>fork handling has been improved; stacks in the child are freed;
  atfork handlers are removed if they were registered from a module
  which gets unloaded.</li>

<li>pthread_tryjoin_np and pthread_timedjoin_np are implemented</li>

<li>TSD handling corrected and optimized.</li>

<li>many more tests which also test the underlying kernel implementation.</li>

<li>the build infrastructure has been implemented so that the DSO and
  archives are built in usable form and with correct named.</li>

<li>libthread_db has been implemented.  This is the library which is
  needed by all program which need to get access to internals of
  libpthread (mainly debuggers).</li>

<li>the CPU clock functions are implemented</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>The white paper hasn't yet been updated.  It's still available at</p>

<p><a href="http://people.redhat.com/drepper/nptl-design.pdf">http://people.redhat.com/drepper/nptl-design.pdf</a></p>

<p>This release should be ready for some serious testing.  I know it is
hard to compile which I why I'm looking into providing binary RPMs.
They can be used on non-critical systems.  I'll only be able to
provide binaries for RHL8 based systems, though, and the kernel still
must be installed separately.</p>

<p>The next steps will include:</p>

<p>

<ul>

<li>write more tests and fix the bugs which are discovered this way</li>

<li>update the white paper</li>

<li>write and run more performance tests</li>

<li>port to IA-64</li>

<p>J.A. Magallon was concerned about testing this, if it required Linus
Torvalds' latest BitKeeper snapshot. He asked, <quote who="J.A. Magallon">could
you state what new kernel features are needed (futexes, cpu-affinity syscalls,
signalling changes...).  Perhaps people can use 2.4 -ac or -aa trees.</quote>
But Ingo Molnar replied:</p>

<quote who="Ingo Molnar">

<p>too many to list, really. It's more than 60 separate patches that went into
2.5 in the past 2 months that implement all the necessery infrastructure for
NPTL-style 1:1 threading. Futexes had to be fixed too, so it's not like you
could use the existing 2.4 futex patch for NPTL. I'll attempt a 2.4 backport
of all the threading bits within the next couple of weeks, but it's not a
matter of a couple of hours ...</p>

<p>but, 2.5 isnt all that bad these days, and Arjan is currently working on
2.5 kernel rpms, to make it even easier to try out. (it will be announced
to phil-list once he's done.)</p>

<p>In response to a BitKeeper patch, Linus Torvalds remarked:</p>

<quote who="Linus Torvalds">

<p>_please_ do this the regular way next time. There's even a script to help
you do it in linux/Documentation/BK-usage/bk-mak-sum, which does it all for
you for BK patches.</p>

<p>(many people end up doing their own thing, you don't have to use that
particular script, of course. But the important thing I want is that the
_email_ should contain enough information to make a good first pass judgement
on what the patch does, and in particular it is important for me to see what a
"bk pull" will actually change.)</p>

<p>That's why the "diffstat" is important to me if I do a BK pull - and why
I want to see the patches as plaintext if I apply stuff to generic files..</p>

<p>So:</p>

<p>

<ul>

<li>if you use BK (which is great - your tree looked fine and the only real
problem was that I had to verify it separately by hand first), please send
one email for the "bk pull", and include a diffstat for the whole thing in
that one email.</li>

<li>if you use patches, please send them as clear-text in the email itself, and
don't think that I want to go fetch them separately from some other site.</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>For optimal exposure, do both - this is what Greg KH does for USB stuff
(he sends the BK email to me and to the kernel list, and sends individual
patches to the kernel list only). Which really helps the people who don't
want to use BK for some reason.</p>

<p>

<ul>

<li>Peter Chubb's 64-bit sector_t patches have been included.  These
  are working fine and are a 2.6 must-have, IMO.</li>

<li>Included Manfred's slab rework.  No problems observed there.</li>

<li>

<p>The per-cpu hot-n-cold pages code continues to disappoint.  For some
  weird reason, the enormous lock contention which was observed in
  rmqueue and __free_pages_ok in 2.5.9 has vanished in 2.5.40 on
  the big ppc64 boxen.  So these patches fix something which isn't
  there any more.  Could be related to the hardware (which changed);
  we're still poking at it.</p>

<p>  One test which involves repeatedly writing and then truncating smallish
  files was sped up 60%, which indicates that the cache locality stuff
  is working correctly, but it's a bit artificial.</p>

<p>  Ingo said that his 2.4-based per-cpu-pages patch was beneficial to
  specweb, but nobody has tested these patches with specweb.  Hint.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Started work on /proc/sys/vm/swappiness.  Setting it to 100% gives
  you current 2.5 behaviour.  Setting it to 0 feels pretty similar to
  2.4.19.</p>

<p>  I ran it for half a day; seems to work OK.  Although running a KDE
  desktop on dual 25" monitors in 96 megabytes is not a ton of fun.</p>

<p>  More things to be done on this.  If anyone tests this code on a
  small machine, you really do need to set /proc/sys/vm/dirty_async_ratio
  to 15.  I'll be making this dynamic.</p>

</li>

<li>Started work on a page reservation API to solve the problem of ENOMEM
  during radix-tree and pte_chain allocations.  It's untested and unused
  at present.</li>

<li>Dropped the sard patch for now - it kept on getting stomped by the
  gendisk rework.</li>

<p>Robert Love said to Marcelo Tosatti:</p>

<quote who="Robert Love">

<p>In 2.5, it is unsafe to assume the current processor does not change out
from under you - thus you must be atomic when calling smp_processor_id().
We introduced the get_cpu() and put_cpu() methods to provide a safe way to
access the current processor.</p>

<p>This patch back-ports those interfaces to 2.4.  Note they do nothing
special: get_cpu() simply returns smp_processor_id() and put_cpu() is a no-op.
But this will allow easier back-porting from 2.5 and common code-base for
drivers, etc.  It also does not hurt to be explicit that you do not want
the processor to change.</p>

<p>As an example, I converted one use of smp_processor_id() to the new
interface.</p>

<p>Linus Torvalds replied:</p>

<p>I agree. bcopy should just DIE. Some architectures may have historical

definitely a memcpy with no overlap), but I think that's long gone (I know

some modules even uglier than they were before.</p>

<p>No matter if you think bcopy should work for overlapping memory or not,
there is a replacement standard function (by the 1989 ANSI C standard, so

<p>That's a purely mechanical change, on the same level as the kernel janitor

<p>Adam Belay announced:</p>

<quote who="Adam Belay">

<p>Linux Plug and Play Support V0.6</p>

<p>The included patch is essentially a Linux Plug and Play Support rewrite.  It
contains many significant improvements, including the following:</p>

<p>

<ol>

<li>A Global Plug and Play Layer</li>

<ul>

<li>Now drivers do not have to worry about which plug and play protocol they are
using.  Calls are made directly to the Linux Plug and Play Layer and then
forwarded to the appropriate protocol.</li>

<li>This will make it very easy to integrate ACPI PnP support when it's
ready</li>

</ul>

<li>A complete Plug and Play BIOS driver</li>

<ul>

<li>The Plug and Play BIOS now supports reading and writing of resource
configurations.</li>

<li>It is now possible to enable disabled PNPBIOS devices.  Therefore the user can
safely enable PnP OS support in their BIOS.</li>

</ul>

<li>Driver Model Integration</li>

<ul>

<li>The entire plug and play layer is integrated into the driver model</li>

<li>The user interface is housed here</li>

<li>PnP protocols are listed under the bus "pnp"</li>

</ul>

<li>A powerful global resource configuration interface</li>

<ul>

<li>The user can use this to activate PnP devices for legacy and user-level
drivers</li>

<li>To enable a device the user can type the following to the desired driverfs
listing:<br />
# echo "auto" > resources</li>

<li>To manually set resources type the following:<br />
# echo "manual &lt;depnum&gt; &lt;static/dynamic&gt;" &gt; resources<br />
&lt;depnum&gt; = configuration number<br />
&lt;static&gt; = for next boot<br />
&lt;dynamic&gt; = now<br />
ex:<br />
# echo "manual 1 dynamic" &gt; resources</li>

<li>To disable a device type the following:<br />
# echo "disable" &gt; resources</li>

</ul>

<li>Automatic resource allocation for needed devices</li>

<li>A PnP device name database</li>

</ol>

</p>

<p>And many more improvements.</p>

<p>The code is relatively stable and I encourage anyone who's curious to try it
out.  Currently only the serial driver has been converted to the new APIs but
that includes just about every modem.  Patches to convert other drivers are
welcome.  Feel free to send bug reports, questions, comments, etc.</p>

<p>The Linux Test Project test suite
LTP-20021008.tgz has been released. Visit our website (<a
href="http://ltp.sourceforge.net">http://ltp.sourceforge.net</a>) to
download the latest version of the testsuite, and for information
on test results on pre-releases, release candidates &amp;
stable releases of the kernel. There is also a list of test
cases that are expected to fail, please find the list at (<a
href="http://ltp.sourceforge.net/expected-errors.php">http://ltp.sourceforge.net/expected-errors.php</a>)</p>

<p>The highlights of this release are:</p>

<p>

<ul>

<li>Updated the STAX LTP driver. You can now specify client and server
logging paths.  The ability to define how long a single test is allowed run
has been added. Plus, hardware information is now included in the logs for
each client. The HowTo has been updated as well.</li>

<li>Updated the Database Opensource Test Suite (DOTS) with added functionality
to allow the use of MySQL and PostreSQL databases, complementing the
existing features that allow the use of DB2, Oracle, and Sybase databases.
Additionally, DOTS is now available as an on-demand test suite at the
Open Source Development Lab's Linux Kernel Scalable Test Platform. (<a
href="http://www.osdl.org/stp">http://www.osdl.org/stp</a>)</li>

<li>An additional shared memory control test has been added (shmctl04), that
tests the SHM_INFO command.</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>We encourage the community to post results, patches, or new tests on our
mailing list, and to use the CVS bug tracking facility to report problems
that you might encounter. More details available at our web-site.</p>

<p>I have put a new version of the IPMI driver on my home page (<a
href="http://home.attbi.com/~minyard">http://home.attbi.com/~minyard</a>)
that fixes a bug.  A previous unannounce version is there (v3) that adds
IPMB broadcast support and fixes a bug.  If you are using this driver, you
want to update to the newest version.  These are only supplied as a patches
against the previous version since the patches are small and apply to all
kernel versions.  If someone wants a full patch, I can do that, too.</p>

<p>I was toying with the idea of adding a socket interface to the IPMI driver.
This way, it would naturally handle separation of addressing and data,
and it wouldn't take up a character device.  I think I could map everything
the driver does into standard network calls, and the IPMB bus is sort of a
network, anyway.  Does anyone have any opinions on this?</p>

<p>PS - In case you don't know, IPMI is a standard for system
management, it provides ways to detect the managed devices in the
system and sensors attached to them.  You can get more information at <a

<quote who="Christer Weinigel">

<p>My SCx200 patches just turned up in Linux-2.5.41, so I would like to
submit them for 2.4 too so that 2.4 and 2.5 are synced.</p>

<p>The patch adds support for the National Semiconductor SCx200 processor
family to Linux 2.4.  The patch consists of the following drivers:</p>

<p>arch/i386/kernel/scx200.c -- give kernel access to the GPIO pins</p>

<p>drivers/chars/scx200_gpio.c -- give userspace access to the GPIO pins<br />
drivers/chars/scx200_wdt.c -- watchdog timer driver</p>

<p>drivers/i2c/scx200_i2c.c -- use any two GPIO pins as an I2C bus<br />
drivers/i2c/scx200_acb.c -- driver for the Access.BUS hardware</p>

<p>drivers/mtd/maps/scx200_docflash.c -- driver for a CFI flash connected
to the DOCCS pin</p>

<p>If they look ok to you, please apply.</p>

  title="ACL Support For ext2 And ext3"

<p>Theodore Y. Ts'o announced:</p>

<quote who="Theodore Y. Ts'o">

<p>The following patch set adds ACL support to the ext2/3 filesystem.
It is a port of the 0.8.50 patches from Andreas Gruenbacher.  It requires
the Extended Attribute patches which I had sent earlier as a pre-requisite,
and represents the 2nd of 3 sets of patches from the acl.bestbits.at code.
(The first set was the EA patches; this is the second set of patches; and
the third set of patches adds ACL support to NFS, so that the NFS server
respects the ACL set on the filesystem.)</p>

<p>Some of these patches in this set are shared in common with the XFS
filesystem, and are needed for ACL support in XFS as well.  These patches are
versus 2.5.40, and still reflect the original design decision of allowing ext2
and ext3 ACL support to be available as separate standalone modules.  (See the
discussion of the EA patches about whether or not this makes sense.)</p>

<p>Please comment/bleed on these patches.</p>
