Hello,

At the CAUUG AGM on 30 November 2002, the members present elected Martin Schwenke (president@canb.auug.org.au) President of CAUUG. Bob Edwards) was elected Treasurer (treasurer@canb.auug.org.au, and Michael Still) was elected Secretary (secretary@canb.auug.org.au. The term for these elections are until the next AGM, which will be in approximately November 2003.

The committee believes that a reasonable goal for the coming year is to:
 - host four technical symposiums (the first one having been held on 30 November 2002)
 - and promote the use of Open Source and Unix based solutions within local government

The new committee feels that there are good reasons to co opt more people onto the committee for the 2002-2003 period, in order to ease the workload associated with pursuing our goals for the year.

We are also especially interested in people who feel that they have specific skills or contacts which will assist in the pursuit of this agenda.

Therefore, the CAUUG committee invites expressions of interest in being co opted onto the CAUUG committee for the period 2002-2003. The committee can be contacted by email at committee@canb.auug.org.au.

Thanks for your time,
Michael Still
Secretary, CAUUG
