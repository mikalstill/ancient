Hello,

At the CAUUG AGM on 30 November 2002, the members present elected Martin
Schwenke (president@cauug.org.au) President of CAUUG. Bob Edwards
(treasurer@cauug.org.au) was elected treasurer, and Michael Still
(secretary@cauug.org.au) was elected secretary. The term for these
elections are until the next AGM, which will be in approximately November
2003.

The committee believes that a reasonable goal for the coming year is to:
 - host four technical symposiums (the first one having been held on 30
November 2002)
 - and promote the use of Open Source and Unix based solutions within
local government

The new committee feels that there are good reasons to coopt more people
onto the committee for the 2002-2003 period, in order to ease the workload
associated with persuing our goals for the year.

We are also especially interested in people who feel that they have
specific skills or contacts which will assist in the persuit of this
agenda.

Therefore, the CAUUG committee invites expressions of interest in being
coopted onto the CAUUG committee for the period 2002-2003.

Thanks for your time,
Michael Still
Secretary, CAUUG
