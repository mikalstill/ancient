Committee formalities

  Co-opting other committee members

     * What other skills do we need?

     * Did we have people in mind? (Steve Jenkin, Anthony David)

     * Do we need to advertise?

     * Is there an official AUUG procedure?

   Contacts within government to pursue our Open Source advocacy agenda.
   Reliable people willing to help out would be good as well.

   It was agreed that an email should be sent out to the ACT AUUG mailing
   list asking for expressions of interest. The email read as follows:

        Hello,                                                                    
                                                                                  
        At the CAUUG AGM on 30 November 2002, the members present elected Martin  
        Schwenke (president@canb.auug.org.au) President of CAUUG. Bob Edwards     
        was elected Treasurer (treasurer@canb.auug.org.au, and Michael Still was  
        elected Secretary (secretary@canb.auug.org.au. The term for these         
        elections are until the next AGM, which will be in approximately November 
        2003.                                                                     
                                                                                  
        The committee believes that a reasonable goal for the coming year is to:  
         - host four technical symposiums (the first one having been held on      
           30 November 2002)                                                      
         - and promote the use of Open Source and Unix based solutions within     
           local government                                                       
                                                                                  
        The new committee feels that there are good reasons to co opt more people 
        onto the committee for the 2002-2003 period, in order to ease the         
        workload associated with pursuing our goals for the year.                 
                                                                                  
        We are also especially interested in people who feel that they have       
        specific skills or contacts which will assist in the pursuit of this      
        agenda.                                                                   
                                                                                  
        Therefore, the CAUUG committee invites expressions of interest in being   
        co opted onto the CAUUG committee for the period 2002-2003. The committee 
        can be contacted by email at committee@canb.auug.org.au.                  
                                                                                  
        Thanks for your time,                                                     
        Michael Still                                                             
        Secretary, CAUUG                                                          

   This email is yet to be approved by Martin.

   There is an AUUG chapter handbook and set of procedures, we need to
   acquire a copy of these. An email has been sent to try to determine where
   these procedures are stored - the outcome of this request was that AUUG
   National is currently reviewing the procedures manual, and a copy will be
   made available when it is ready. David Purdue is the committee member
   conducting the review. We can co-opt people until the next AGM.

     * Next meeting: Should CAUUG contact David and offer assistance?

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Finances

     * How much does CAUUG have in the bank?

     * How much did we earn from the 30 November 2002 seminar?

     * Has this money been forwarded to AUUG national?

     * Has Bob Edwards been reimbursed for expenditure on 30 November 2002?

   Somewhere over $20,000. Chase Bob.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Next meeting

     * When is the next meeting? The second Thursday in January 2003 is the
       9th

   It was agreed that the next committee meeting would be 9 January 2003.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Open Source advocacy

     * What is Martin's position as an employee of IBM?

     * What is the next step?

   Martin's position is being resolved now. Steven Jenkin is meeting with the
   ACT treasurer next week. Need to be careful not to oversell the Open
   Source solution too much, manage expectations. Remind them of EVAS.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Technical symposium

     * Target date: 1 March 2003

     * Theme: TBD

     * Things we could improve?

     * Things we did right?

     * Make a survey form available to attendees next time

   Need to have a specific meeting devoted to this. Do a call for papers next
   time, which needs to go out really soon. We'll look more at this after
   Christmas.
