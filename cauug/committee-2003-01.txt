Co-opting other committee members

     * Draft email developed. Is everyone happy with it?

        Hello,                                                                    
                                                                                  
        At the CAUUG AGM on 30 November 2002, the members present elected Martin  
        Schwenke (president@canb.auug.org.au) President of CAUUG. Bob Edwards     
        was elected Treasurer (treasurer@canb.auug.org.au, and Michael Still was  
        elected Secretary (secretary@canb.auug.org.au. The term for these         
        elections are until the next AGM, which will be in approximately November 
        2003.                                                                     
                                                                                  
        The committee believes that a reasonable goal for the coming year is to:  
         - host four technical symposiums (the first one having been held on      
           30 November 2002)                                                      
         - and promote the use of Open Source and Unix based solutions within     
           local government                                                       
                                                                                  
        The new committee feels that there are good reasons to co opt more people 
        onto the committee for the 2002-2003 period, in order to ease the         
        workload associated with pursuing our goals for the year.                 
                                                                                  
        We are also especially interested in people who feel that they have       
        specific skills or contacts which will assist in the pursuit of this      
        agenda.                                                                   
                                                                                  
        Therefore, the CAUUG committee invites expressions of interest in being   
        co opted onto the CAUUG committee for the period 2002-2003. The committee 
        can be contacted by email at committee@canb.auug.org.au.                  
                                                                                  
        Thanks for your time,                                                     
        Michael Still                                                             
        Secretary, CAUUG
