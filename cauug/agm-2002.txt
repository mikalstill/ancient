Report from National Executive Officer

   Stephen Rothwell notes there has been an on-going concern by the National
   Executive over the local chapters holding accounts, especially as chapter
   activity can be described as "semi-existent".

   The National Executive would like to consolidate money for all chapters,
   only AUUG Incorporated has any legal standing for GST, ABN and quarterly
   BAS. There are also concerns about the local chapter accounts not being
   audited, whilst "national" has prudential responsibility.

   The proposal from the National Executive is for all chapters to transfer
   any monies to the main AUUG Incorporated account, then to maintain
   internal account balances for locally raised money for each chapter in the
   AUUG Incorporated books (a standard accounting practice). Cheques and
   payments will be requested of Liz Carrol, AUUG secretary, who will
   organize payment. AUUG Incorporated has credit card facilities -- a real
   bonus for running local events.

   Income from local events, such as Rasmus Lerdorf's PHP tutorial and the
   Canberra AUUG Technical Symposiums will be credited to the CAUUG account
   in the AUUG Incorporated books.

   CAUUG currents has about $20,000 in a local bank account, and another
   $10,000 has already been loaned (transfered) to AUUG Incorporated. Both
   account signatories, the (ex)treasurer David Baldwin, and (ex)president
   Peter Wishart were not present at this meeting. They will need to be
   approached by the incoming treasurer to transfer the money to the AUUG
   Incorporated account and close the local chapter account.

   The motion was put "Directing the incoming treasurer to arrange for the
   local chapter account to be closed and the money transfered to AUUG
   Incorporated". Motion carried without dissent.

Report of Activities

  Bob Edwards

   Bob has been actively pursuing a number of initiatives to promote Open
   Source through CAUUG.

   Within the ACT Department of Education, many colleges already offer Cisco
   and Microsoft certification courses. CAUUG as an Open Source advocate
   should be promoting the teaching and use of Open Source in the school,
   classroom and staff common rooms. Cisco and Microsoft offer "freebies" and
   very well structured course content and materials for teachers, making it
   very easy for them to present the material. Open Source will have to
   eventually match that level of support to gain acceptance.

   Bob proposed to spend some of CAUUG's finances on finding novel ways of
   promoting Open Source and assisting teachers in using Open Source in
   schools. One way of facilitating this is the creation of an Open Source
   award for teachers. This will require and intimate knowledge of what
   teachers are doing, and will need "inside help".

   There is also a need for certified training in Open Source methods and
   applications for teachers. ADFA teaches some Linux and other courses,
   these could be used as a base, for example:

     * Half day in services for teachers

     * A networking with Open Source course

     * A programming with Open Source course

   The main thrust of Bob's talk was a discussion of how to "take back the
   classroom". This resulted in the following proposals:

     * CAUUG could employ later year tertiary students to run classes on Open
       Source in schools, or just present talks. Topics would include "an
       introduction to Open Source" and "how the Open Source paradigm works".

     * RedHat are obvious people to approach to see if they have any courses
       to offer or if they would be interested in getting involved.

     * CAUUG should remain vendor neutral, and promote standard Open Source
       tools.

     * Knoppix could be used as an introduction to Linux in schools because
       it boots of the CD ROM and doesn't alter the configuration of the
       machine. Teachers only have control over the machines within labs

     * Windows is bundled with all ACT Education department personal
       computers. Schools have to pay for the Microsoft Office licenses and
       prices have increased. This could be an ideal point of leverage to
       introduce OpenOffice.org into schools.

     * ABIword is also available as a faster, lighter weight, word processing
       package.

  Anthony David

   Anthony declared his affiliation with the Australian Democrats, and the
   fact that he stood as a candidate for the ACT legislative assembly at the
   most recent ACT election. He recently had support for Open Source added to
   the Democrats platform.

   Worldwide, governments are mandating the use of, or looking at the
   benefits of free software and Open Source. Governments used to be leaders
   in the adoption of IT and have become very conservative over the last
   decade or so. Anthony has been lobbying the ACT government and parties
   directly.

   The IT provider for the ACT government is named inTACT, and strategies
   need to include them.

   The National AUUG body has started lobbying NOIE and there is a CIO
   briefing scheduled for February 2003. AUUG has also made a submission to
   the Federal government on the "handling of information and security".

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Miscellaneous
