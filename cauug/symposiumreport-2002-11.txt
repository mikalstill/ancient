About the Canberra AUUG chapter

   Canberra has been the proud owner of a AUUG chapter for many
   years now. This chapter has effectively been in recess for the
   last few of those years however. The technical symposium held
   on 30 November 2002 was seen as an opportunity to revive the
   chapter, and therefore an AGM was held beforehand.

   Tthe members present elected Martin Schwenke
   (president@canb.auug.org.au) President of CAUUG. Bob Edwards
   was elected Treasurer (treasurer@canb.auug.org.au), and
   Michael Still was elected Secretary
   (secretary@canb.auug.org.au). The term for these elections are
   until the next AGM, which will be in approximately November
   2003.

   The chapter is currently holding monthly meetings in
   conjunction with a local Unix User's Group (UUNITE) on every
   second Thursday of the month at the IBM Building in Barton.
   These meetings commence at 6pm.

30 November 2002: Interoperability

   The 30 November technical symposium focused on operating
   system interoperability. The technical symposium did introduce
   the concept of a "snippet" talk, which was unrelated to the
   theme of the symposium, but of general interest.

   The programme for the technical symposium was as follows:

     * Andrew Tridgell: Semantic differences between Windows and
       Unix systems
     * Bob Edwards: Experiences at DCS, ANU, running Linux on the
       desktop after 3 years in a Solaris environment
     * Andrew Bartlett: A look at Windows Authentication
     * Michael Still: Implementing a DNS server with shell
       (snippet)
     * Brad Hards: Zeroconf Networking (snippet)

Michael Still: Implementing a DNS server with shell (snippet)

   I gave a talk on implementing a Domain Name System (DNS)
   server in bash script. This script runs from inetd, and aims
   to be the slowest, least secure, and hardest to configure DNS
   server on the market today. At the time of the talk, the
   server could parse DNS requests, but could not respond. It has
   since been determined that this is because of the use of
   disconnected UDP sockets in both inetd and xinetd.

   There's a special irony in patching your inetd daemon so that
   you can run the least efficient DNS server ever written.

Brad Hards: Zeroconf Networking (snippet)

   Brad gave a talk on zero configuration IP, which is a set of
   protocols which allows machines to be arbitarily connected to
   a physical network, and then these machines configure their
   own network settings. This is based on
