>        Hello,
        
        At the CAUUG AGM on 30 November 2002, the members present elected Martin 
        Schwenke (president@canb.auug.org.au) President of CAUUG. Bob Edwards 
        was elected Treasurer (treasurer@canb.auug.org.au, and Michael Still was 
        elected Secretary (secretary@canb.auug.org.au. The term for these 
        elections are until the next AGM, which will be in approximately November
        2003.
        
        The committee believes that a reasonable goal for the coming year is to:
         - host four technical symposiums (the first one having been held on 
           30 November 2002)
         - and promote the use of Open Source and Unix based solutions within 
           local government
        
        The new committee feels that there are good reasons to co opt more people
        onto the committee for the 2002-2003 period, in order to ease the 
        workload associated with pursuing our goals for the year.
        
        We are also especially interested in people who feel that they have 
        specific skills or contacts which will assist in the pursuit of this 
        agenda.
        
        Therefore, the CAUUG committee invites expressions of interest in being 
        co opted onto the CAUUG committee for the period 2002-2003. The committee
        can be contacted by email at committee@canb.auug.org.au.
        
        Thanks for your time,
        Michael Still
        Secretary, CAUUG</PRE

>There is an AUUG chapter handbook and set of procedures, we need to acquire a copy of these. An email has been sent to try to determine where these procedures are stored &#8212; the outcome of this request was that AUUG National is currently reviewing the procedures manual, and a copy will be made available when it is ready. David Purdue is the committee member conducting the review. We can co-opt people until the next AGM.</P
