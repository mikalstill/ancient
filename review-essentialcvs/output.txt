   I've been using CVS for quite some time now, but because of
   the way I work, and the sort of projects I work on, there are
   some features I have simply never had to use, or didn't even
   know existed. TODO

   The structure of Essential CVS is logical. Essential CVS
   discusses what CVS is, why you would use it (including it's
   uses for systems administrators), and then immediately
   presents a quick start guide. The quickstart guide takes the
   form of a cook book of the common operations you would perform
   in every day CVS use: importing projects; checking in and out
   files; commiting changes; updating your sandbox; and so on.

   Essential CVS then moves onto chapters which cover some of the
   specifics. For example, chapter two discusses every day use of
   CVS, in a little more detail than the quickstart. As I read
   the book from cover to cover, this felt a little strange, as
   there was repeated content quite frequently. Then again, it is
   obvious that this part of the book is built as a reference, in
   which case repeating information makes the book much more user
   friendly.

   The quickstart chapter presents enough information for you to
   walk away and start using CVS. The later, more specific,
   chapters, then provide the information you need to solve more
   specific questions as you encounter then. The book takes
   detail and accuracy seriously, for example in several places
   it mentions that comments in the CVS source code imply that a
   given feature may change in the future, and user caution
   should be shown.

   Essential CVS also provides a large volume of command
   reference information, listing the command line parameters to
   the various CVS tools, and their use. Based on a brief perusal
   of the cvs manpage, this is probably a good thing, as I found
   the format of the command reference within Essential CVS to be
   much more readable than the man page.

   As the majority of Essential CVS is a reference book, it live
   and dies by the quality of it's index. The difficult question
   as a reviewer is how to test an index? You could judge it on
   size, but that would only tell you that a lot of words were in
   the index. If those words are not relevant, then the index is
   still of little use. I chose instead of think of four or five
   things which I thought I might need with CVS, and then used
   the index to pull out the relevant information. Thus, if I
   could find the things I thought I needed in the index, then
   the index passes my simple test.

   Essential CVS met all of my index tests. For all of the things
   I looked up in the index, which ranged from information on how
   to commit binary files sensibly to CVS, to how to access a
   repository remotely via SSH, how to configure build scripts as
   a commit requirement, the index took me ot the relevant
   information to within a page or two. Thus, I am happy to
   declare Essential CVS to be a useful reference book.

   Jennifer is also an Australian, which is always a good thing.
