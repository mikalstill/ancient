   Did you know that there is a maximum of ten words in a
   Google(TM) search, or that repeating a word results in
   different search results? What about the fact that some search
   types are antisocial, and wont work with other search types?
   How about the fact that the order of your keywords affects the
   results that are returned? Neither did I, and I use Google(TM)
   nearly every day.

   I should probably start this review by letting you know that I
   don't believe that Google(TM) Hacks is not a book aimed at
   developers. It lists 100 interesting things you can do with
   Google(TM), in a quite accessible manner. That's not to say
   there is no code in Google(TM) Hacks -- on the contrary, there
   are regular examples in Perl of how to parse saved Google(TM)
   output, and use the Google(TM) API -- it is more that these
   examples are presented as utilities to use as is, and are not
   the topic of discussion in their own right. I would be
   comfortable with handing this book to a school child who
   needed to know how to use Google(TM) effectively. Especially
   if they had used the Internet before and know what a browser,
   and a URL are.

   Then again, this doesn't mean that Google(TM) Hacks is
   simplistic. It still describes how to alter URLs, how to
   search using the Google(TM) special syntaxes, and so forth.
   Google(TM) Hacks even describes topics such as how to search
   date ranges (you can specify any Julian date range to
   Google(TM), although it must be an integer).

   The Google(TM) API is a quite useful part of the Google(TM)
   offerings. The Google(TM) API is offered by via a SOAP
   interface, which makes it relatively easy to access for most
   programmers. Google(TM) Hacks describes how to reference the
   Google(TM) API in a variety of programming languages, and then
   goes on to show a series of example applications written in
   Perl.

   Google(TM) Hacks also has a fun side. There is a section
   describing Google(TM) poetry, and Google(TM) art. The basic
   process of Google(TM) art is to post a message to a Usenet
   group (preferably one of the test groups) which contains
   keywords contrived in such a manner that a picture is
   displayed when a specific search is executed in Google(TM)
   Groups. The colour of each pixel results from the automatic
   keyword hi-lighting which occurs in Google(TM) Groups search
   results. Your picture is somewhat limited however, in that
   Google(TM) searches only support ten keywords, and therefore
   you can only have ten colours in your picture. The resolution
   supported by the text interface is also somewhat limited.

   Some of the hacks described in Google(TM) Hacks are also quite
   non-hackish. For example, there is a whole section on how to
   build a useful website that Googlebot will find attractive to
   index. There is also discussion on possible formulations for
   the PageRank(TM) algorithm, as well as how to maximize
   Google(TM)'s PageRank(TM) for your site.

   Because each hack is meant to stand on it's own in this
   "reference mode" of use, there is a lot of repeated
   information. For example, many of the hacks describe how there
   is no access to a particular piece of functionality from the
   Google(TM) API, and that screen scraping in an automated
   manner is a breach of the Google(TM) terms of service.
   Similarly, the same prelude to setup the Google(TM) API is
   repeated in many of the examples of the API's use. Having read
   Google(TM) Hacks from cover to cover, this repetition was
   really starting to get on my nerves by the end of the book.

   In conclusion, once you bear in mind that Google(TM) Hacks is
   not aimed at developers, its a good read. It also makes an
   excellent reference for those who regularly use Google(TM), or
   are interested in learning more. The book is written in a
   manner which makes the vast majority of the content available
   to technical novices, whilst still discussing technical issues
   which really matter.
