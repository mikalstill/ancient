CLASS="EMPHASIS"

> discusses what CVS is, why you would use it (including it's uses for systems administrators), and then immediately presents a quick start guide. The quickstart guide takes the form of a cook book of the common operations you would perform in every day CVS use: importing projects; checking in and out files; commiting changes; updating your sandbox; and so on.</P

> then moves onto chapters which cover some of the specifics. For example, chapter two discusses every day use of CVS, in a little more detail than the quickstart. As I read the book from cover to cover, this felt a little strange, as there was repeated content quite frequently. Then again, it is obvious that this part of the book is built as a reference, in which case repeating information makes the book much more user friendly.</P

>The quickstart chapter presents enough information for you to walk away and start using CVS. The later, more specific, chapters, then provide the information you need to solve more specific questions as you encounter then. The book takes detail and accuracy seriously, for example in several places it mentions that comments in the CVS source code imply that a given feature may change in the future, and user caution should be shown.</P

You could judge it on size, but that would only tell you that a lot of words were in the index. If those words are not relevant, then the index is still of little use. I chose instead of think of four or five things which I thought I might need with CVS, and then used the index to pull out the relevant information. Thus, if I could find the things I thought I needed in the index, then the index passes my simple test.</P

For all of the things I looked up in the index, which ranged from information on how to commit binary files sensibly to CVS, to how to access a repository remotely via SSH, how to configure build scripts as a commit requirement, the index took me ot the relevant information to within a page or two. Thus, I am happy to declare <SPAN
