<!-- (C) O'Reilly & Associates, 1994.  This is a supplementary
     character set to enrich the basic ISOlat1 (ISO 646 extended
     ASCII) character set.  All needed characters that are not part of
     ISOlat1 will go in this file.  The purpose is to avoid loading
     unnecessary characters that are not used, so that the user will
     more readily find and use the characters that are needed.  The
     character definitions are taken from ISO character maps, hence
     the following statement. -->
