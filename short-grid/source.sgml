The grid and open grid services architecture
Ian Foster
Mathematics and Computer Science Division
... (see website)

www.globus.org


Grids as infrastructure (e.g. electrical power distribution)
Computing and storage / data don't obey these rules yet
What about the Internet?
On demand, ubiqitious access to computing, data and services

The emergence of the grid
  E science -- the original grid driver (previously theory and experiment)
  Very large db mining
  Simulations
  Remote device access
  
"Resource sharing and coordinated problem solving in dynamic, multi-institutional virtual organizations"

Early 90's: gigabit test beds
Mid 90's: early experiments in networks and software
2002: large communities have emerged

Example: CERN's Large Hadron Collider
  1800 physicists
  150 insitutes
  32 countries

  100PB data
  50,000 CPUs
  (by 2010)

Example: NASA aviation safety

Technical requirements
  Dynamic dormation and management of virt orgs
  Online neg of acces to services (inc schedualling)
  Configur of apps and sys
  Mnagement of dist infra

Globus toolkit
  since 1996
  small stds based set of protocols
  information centric design
  open source implementation (large community)
  Enabler of services and applications




Grids and e business

  Framentation of enterprise infrastructure
  The rise of eUtility (outsourcing, ecomomies of scale: IBM, HP, SUN, MS et al)
  b2b
  Ubiq QOS

  On demand access to computing
  New applications and services
  Solution to ent computing problems

  Fight AIDs at home
  butterfly.net


Technology convergence

  Refactor globus protocol suite to enable common base and expose key capabilities
  Service orientation
  Embrace key web service technologies: std idl (from wsdl), leverage commercial efforts
  :. standard interfaces and behaviours which define required elements

  web services address discovery and invocation of persistent services
  must also handle transient service instances

  web services
    w3c: ms, ibm, sun, +
    wsdl
    soap
    ws-inspection

  life time of state
    explicit destroy
    request that the service keepalive for a little bit longer


Virtual data
  GriPhyN
  Most data is in fact computationally corrected and perhaps even simulated
  Need to track transformation and derivation information
