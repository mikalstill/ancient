To run gtalkbot:

 - Install the dependancies. On Debian / Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install python-pyxmpp python-pyxmpp-doc

 - Write a plugin! There is a sample on in plugins/mythbot.py
 - Create a password file and put it somewhere

	The format is:
	<username><tab><password>

	For example:
	exampleuser@gmail.com	banana

 - Create a jabber or Google Talk account for the bot
 - Create a config file. It should contain:

connectwith     <account to connect with>
password        <password>
pluginsdir      <path to plugins directory>
authfile	<path to your password file>

 - Start up gtalkbot:

	./gtalkbot.py ~/.gtalkbotrc

 - Now you can IM the bot account, and off you go. You'll need to start off
   with a "auth <password>" to login to the bot
