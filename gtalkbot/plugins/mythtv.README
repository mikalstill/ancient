This is a sample gtalkbot module. It uses the MythTV telnet network control
interface that a MythTV front end provides (if enabled) to control that MythTV
front end.

You can do basically anything you can do in the MythTV telnet interface, with
the exception that the "query location" command also returns the name of the
recording, instead of just it's filename like the telnet interface.
