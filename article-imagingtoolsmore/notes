Talk about mogrify (repeat operations on many files)

Animated GIFs?




In this article you have the following example:
for img in `ls *.jpg`
do
  convert -sample 25%x25% $img thumb-$img
done

You can better write it in this way:
for img in *.jpg
do
  convert -sample 25%x25% "$img" thumb-"$img"
done

Using `ls` and not using dblquotes will produce bad results when files have 
a bit strange names (ie. spaces in them).

Anyway, really nice article. Thank you.





As sholden pointed out in response to your article 
(http://lwn.net/Articles/40353/) you should never use `ls *.jpg`. ("A 
useless use of ls, and a way to get an unnecessary "argument list" to 
long error, and *strange* behaviour if there's a directory which matches 
*.jpg.")

Instead, just write:

for img in *.jpg
do
    |convert -sample 25%x25% $img thumb-$img|
done

If possible, please update the article so others can avoid this mistake too.
