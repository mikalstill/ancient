 <abstract>
<para><emphasis>There's nothing quite like command-line tools for handling large batches of tasks, and image manipulations are no exception. Web developers and administrators will appreciate the ability to handle large numbers of files easily, either at the command line or in scripts. Programmer Michael Still presents more examples of the ImageMagick suite, this time demonstrating how to put cool curved corners on your images, a variety of different frames and borders, converting to and from Adobe's PDF format, and how to extract all the images from multiple page file formats.</emphasis></para>

<para>Last year I wrote an article for IBM DeveloperWorks about image
manipulations on the command line using ImageMagick. The article was quite
well received, and since then I have fielded many email questions on
ImageMagick. This article expands on the techniques discussed in that
previous article, as well as answering as many of those questions as I
can. If this is the first ImageMagick article from IBM DeveloperWorks that
you've found, you would do well to have a look at this first article as
well -- you will find it linked in the <ahref="#resources">Resources section.</para>

<para>This article takes the form of discussing specific problems as
examples, but the concepts should be applicable to other problem spaces as
well. This is the same approach as taken in the previous article. The
techniques discussed here also work in combination with those we've
discussed previously.</para>

<para>It should be noted that there are many ways to do the things discussed
in this article. I will only discuss the methods I use, and know work for
me. That doesn't mean the other tools out there are broken, it just means
that I'm happy with what I am using now.</para>


<sect1><title>Curving corners</title>

<para>If you have a look at Mac OS/X, and many Web sites, the pictures have
quite nice curved corners. How do you achieve this effect with
ImageMagick? Well, we're going to have to show some ingenuity in producing
this effect by using the <programlisting>composite</programlisting> command.</para>

<para>Before we get there though, let's talk about the strategy we're going
to employ. If you think about it, an image with curved corners can be made
by taking some standard pre-made corners, and superimposing them over the
original image. There's no real need for the corners to be curved even --
we could have angled corners, or something much more fancy.</para>

<sidebar>
<title>The GIMP</title>

<para>The GIMP, the GNU Image Manipulation Package, is a very useful raster
graphics editor, much like Adobe Photoshop. It's great for tweaking
images, or for creating your own new pictures. Check out
the  Resources
section of this article for links to the Gimp and Gimp resources.
</para>

</sidebar>

<para>Remember to make the unwanted parts of the corner transparent. 
This transparency will allow the image we are adding the corners to to 
show through. This can be a little confusing, as some image viewers such 
as <command>xview</command> will show the transparency in black or some other color.</para>



<graphic format="eps" fileref="gen-rounded-ne-xview.eps">


<para>The actual corner image will become more clear when we superimpose it
upon an image, so let's get on with that. I have a thumbnail which I made
earlier of the view from the shore of one of Canberra's lakes. Without the
rounded corners, the thumbnail looks like this:</para>



<graphic format="eps" fileref="gen-lake.eps">


<para>To superimpose one image onto another, you use the <programlisting>composite</programlisting>
command. Let's just do one corner, to see what happens...</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
composite -gravity NorthEast rounded-ne.png lake.png lake-1.png
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>Here, the gravity argument defines where on the image to put the
superimposed image -- in our case the rounded corner. This particular
command gives us the following image:</para>



<graphic format="eps" fileref="gen-lake-1.eps">



<para>So let's do the rest of the corners...</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
composite -gravity NorthEast rounded-ne.png lake.png lake-1.png <br />
composite -gravity NorthWest rounded-nw.png lake-1.png lake-2.png <br />
composite -gravity SouthEast rounded-se.png lake-2.png lake-3.png <br />
composite -gravity SouthWest rounded-sw.png lake-3.png lake-4.png <br />
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>Which gives us the finished image:</para>



<graphic format="eps" fileref="gen-lake-4.eps">


<para>Which looks kinda cool in my humble opinion. You should also take note
that there is no reason for these corner images to be rounded. If you're
interested in angled corners or such, then they're equally possible --
just change the corner images in a bitmap editor. In fact, you could even
superimpose your logo onto the image instead of a corner.</para>

<para>If you want to use my rounded corners, a URL is listed in the resources
section at the end of this article.</para>

<para>Finally, here's how to round all the corners of all the png images in
a given directory:</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
for img in *.png
do
  composite -gravity NorthEast rounded-ne.png $img.png $img-1.png <br />
  composite -gravity NorthWest rounded-nw.png $img-1.png $img-2.png <br />
  composite -gravity SouthEast rounded-se.png $img-2.png $img-3.png <br />
  composite -gravity SouthWest rounded-sw.png $img-3.png $img-4.png <br />
done
</programlisting>
</para>

<sidebar>
<title>Gravity</title>

<para>The gravity argument specifies where on the background image the
superimposed image is placed. The possible gravities, and their effects
are:</para>



<graphic format="eps" fileref="gen-gravity2.eps">


<para>For example, SouthWest will force the superimposed image to the bottom
left-hand corner of the background image.</para>

</sidebar>


</sect1>
<sect1><title>Putting frames around images</title>

<para>Another thing which several readers asked about was how to add frames
to images. Again, this is relatively easy to do with ImageMagick.</para>

<sect2><title>A raised or lowered border</title>

<para>The first type of frame I will show you is a raised or lowered border.
This effect works by tweaking the colors at the edge of an image to give
the impression that it is either raised above the surrounding surface, or
pushed below it. For the effect, you need to specify a size, with the
horizontal size first, and then the vertical size. These sizes must obey
the rule that twice the size specified must be less than or equal to the
dimension of the image in that direction. For example, you can't specify a
frame size vertically that is more than half the vertical size of the
image.</para>

<para>To create a raised border, use the <emphasis>-raise</emphasis> command-line argument.
For example, to create a 5 pixel by 5 pixel border, we execute:</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
convert -raise 5x5 tree.png tree-raised.png
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>Which gives us the finished image:</para>



<graphic format="eps" fileref="gen-tree-raised.eps">


<para>To create a lowered border, just use the <emphasis>+raise</emphasis> command-line
argument instead. For example:</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
convert +raise 5x5 tree.png tree-lowered.png
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>Which gives a slightly different finished image:</para>



<graphic format="eps" fileref="gen-tree-lowered.eps">



</sect2>
<sect2><title>A simple colored border</title>

<para>If you're after something a little more simple, you might be interested
in a border of just a solid color. ImageMagick can do this for you as
well.</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
convert -bordercolor red -border 5x5 flower.png flower-border.png
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>Which creates:</para>



<graphic format="eps" fileref="gen-flower-border.eps">


<para>What border colors can we specify on the command line? Well, the list
is simply too long to put into this article. To get a copy of the list,
execute this command:</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
convert -list color
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>From bisque to burlywood and from cornsilk to seashell, there are 683 
"basic" colors to choose from -- which is not to mention that you can also 
specify your own colors by using any of the
following formats, where R represents the red value, G the green, B the
blue, and A the alpha (transparency) value:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>#RGB - (R,G,B are hex numbers, 4 bits each) </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>#RRGGBB - (8 bits each)  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>#RRRGGGBBB - (12 bits each)  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>#RRRRGGGGBBBB - (16 bits each)  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>#RGBA - (4 bits each)  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>#RRGGBBAA - (8 bits each)  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>#RRRGGGBBBAAA - (12 bits each)  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>#RRRRGGGGBBBBAAAA - (16 bits each)  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>rgb(r,g,b) - (r,g,b are decimal numbers)  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>rgba(r,g,b,a) - (r,g,b,a are decimal numbers)  </para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</sect2>
<sect2><title>Building a more complicated frame</title>

<para>Next let's build a slightly more complicated frame, using the
<emphasis>-frame</emphasis> command-line argument. First we'll add a simple frame which
is identical (except for the color) to the border we built in the previous
example.</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
convert -mattecolor black -frame 5x5 beach.png beach-frame.png
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>The arguments are <emphasis>-mattcolor</emphasis> and <emphasis>-frame</emphasis> instead of
<emphasis>-bordercolor</emphasis> and <emphasis>-border</emphasis>, but the rest is the same as with
the border command.</para>



<graphic format="eps" fileref="gen-beach-frame.eps">


<para>Now we can add some extra complexity by adding some gray shading
similar to what the <emphasis>-raise</emphasis> command gave us.</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
convert -mattecolor black -frame 5x5+2 beach.png beach-frame2.png
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>Which is getting there:</para>



<graphic format="eps" fileref="gen-beach-frame2.eps">


<para>Finally, we can add some more decoration, to get the final effect I
want...</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
convert -mattecolor black -frame 5x5+2+2 beach.png beach-frame3.png
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>Which finally gives us:</para>



<graphic format="eps" fileref="gen-beach-frame3.eps">


<para>If you're looking at ways to make nice frames for your images, then I
recommend that you spend a few moments playing with the arguments to the
<emphasis>-frame</emphasis> command. For example, here's some interesting frames for a
picture of a rock at King's Canyon, in Australia.</para>

<para>For more information on the various frames available, checkout the
<command>convert</command> manpage.</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
convert -mattecolor gray -frame 25x25+0+25 rock.png rock-frame1.png
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
convert -mattecolor gray -frame 25x25+25+0 rock.png rock-frame2.png
</programlisting>
</para>



<graphic format="eps" fileref="gen-rock-frames.eps">



</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1><title>Processing many images at once</title>

<para>In my previous article, I showed you sample code to apply conversions
to many images at once. As has been pointed out by several people, the
code I showed was not the best way of doing this.</para>

<para>Here's the code I showed you:</para>

<heading refname="" type="code" toc="no" name="" alttoc="">Listing 1. Thumbnailing 
all the JPEGs in the current directory</title>
<programlisting>
for img in `ls *.jpg`
do
  convert -sample 25%x25% $img thumb-$img
done
</programlisting>


<para>Now it turns out that this is poor bash style, as it doesn't handle
spaces in filenames very gracefully (each word will be treated as a
separate filename). Instead, a better way of doing this in bash is to
do:</para>


<programlisting>
for img in *.jpg
do
  convert -sample 25%x25% $img thumb-$img
done
</programlisting>

<para>Which which will handle spaces in filenames much more gracefully.</para>

<para>It turns out, however, that both of these solutions aren't needed with
ImageMagick -- we can just use the <command>mogrify</command> command. <command>mogrify</command>
is used to convert a sequence of images (although it will work for single
images as well).</para>

<para>That code snippet above becomes:</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
mogrify -sample 25%x25% *.jpg
</programlisting>
</para>

<para><emphasis>Note that this will overwrite the original images with new ones.
This is one of the limitations of <command>mogrify</command>, in that it is harder to
specify output filenames.</emphasis> The only way to specify an output filename
is to change the format of the output image compared with the input image.
This will result in a different extension for the new image. For
example:</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
mogrify -format png -sample 25%x25% *.jpg
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>This will create a series of output files where the jpg at the end of
the filename has been replaced with a png, with the associated image
format change.</para>

<para>All of the conversions previously defined will also work with the
<command>mogrify</command> command, so if you don't mind the original images being
overwritten then it's a good choice. If you do mind
that the originals are overwritten, you can either copy them to a
temporary directory to mogrify them and change their names -- or you could
stick with convert and bash.</para>



</sect1>
<sect1><title>PDF handling</title>

<para>So far all of the examples we've discussed, both in this article and
the previous one, have discussed simple conversions where each image
stands alone. ImageMagick can also do interesting conversions to more than
one image at once which are worth mentioning.</para>

<para>The most common example is ImageMagick's PDF handling. Let's imagine a
scenario where you are sent a PDF which is a series of images (one per
page). ImageMagick will extract those images for you into separate files.
For example, here's a screen shot of a PDF document containing some
pictures of my recent trip to linux.conf.au
(which rocked by the
way):</para>



<graphic format="eps" fileref="gen-foo-pdf-smaller.eps">


<para>Let's imagine that the above PDF had been sent to you by a friend. You
want to extract the images for further processing.</para>

<para>The <programlisting>convert</programlisting> can of course extract these images from the PDF
document:</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
convert foo.pdf pages.png
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>This will do what we want -- each page has been extracted to it's own
PNG file. However, there's an unexpected naming side effect.</para>

<heading refname="" type="code" toc="no" name="" alttoc="">Listing 3. Check out
the filenames</title>
<programlisting>
mikal@deathstar:~/foo$ convert foo.pdf pages.png
mikal@deathstar:~/foo$ ls pages*
pages.png.0  pages.png.1  pages.png.2  pages.png.3  pages.png.4
mikal@deathstar:~/foo$ 
</programlisting>


<para>Because the command created more than one PNG file, a unique number has
been appended to the filename. This won't work so well
if you then try to use code or scripts which make assumptions about the
file type based on the extension of the file.</para>

<para>Being a friendly utility, <programlisting>convert</programlisting> allows us to specify the filename a little
better. The command above really should have looked like:</para>


<programlisting>
mikal@deathstar:~/foo$ convert foo.pdf pages-%03d.png
mikal@deathstar:~/foo$ ls pages*  
pages-000.png  pages-001.png  pages-002.png  pages-003.png  pages-004.png
mikal@deathstar:~/foo$ 
</programlisting>

<para>The <emphasis>%03d</emphasis> is a <command>printf</command>-style format specifier. All you need
to know for this use is that <emphasis>%d</emphasis> means a decimal number, and that
you can also pack in a set of leading zeros by inserting a 0&lt;number&gt;
into the sequence. The number specifies the total number of digits the
displayed value should consume.</para>

<para>It should be noted that you can extract PDF pages which also contain
text. What is actually happening under the hood is that ImageMagick is
using Ghostscript to render the page, and then converting it to your
chosen image format. There's no optical character recognition though --
what you get is a bitmap.</para>

<para>You can also convert image files into PDFs with <programlisting>convert</programlisting>.
In fact the PDF from the example above was built with this command:</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
convert dsc* foo.pdf
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>Just pass a list of image files to <command>convert</command>, and make sure that
the last filename in the list is the name of the PDF document to put them
all into.</para>


</sect1>
<sect1><title>Other formats which support more than one image per file</title>

<para>There are 45 other file formats which can store more than one image
when used with ImageMagick, checkout the information in the references list
below.</para>

<para>All of these are handled in the same way as the PDF example
described. Some of these are also really interesting. It's very convenient
to be able to extract the pages of a postscript file as images (think
about having thumbnails of your published papers on your Web site for
instance), or being able to get to all of the pages of that multiple-page
fax you just received as a TIFF image.</para>

<para>You can even extract frames from your MPEG movies, although that
deserves more discussion than I have space for in this article.</para>


</sect1>
<sect1><title>Conclusion</title>

<para>In this article we've expanded on some of the interesting techniques
discussed in my previous article about ImageMagick, including how to round
the corners of your images (especially the thumbnails we discussed last
time), add a variety of nice frames to your images, and process many images at
once. We finished up with how to extract images from multi-page formats,
and how to build new multi-page documents.</para>

<para>If you're looking for more information, then I encourage you to
check out the ImageMagick Web site in the Resources 
section of this
article. Also, if you have any questions feel free to email me.</para>

<para>Many thanks to all those people who asked the sensible questions which
became this article. I also thank you for your patience with how long I
took to answer them.</para>
