<docbody>

<!-- BEGIN THE BODY OF THE ARTICLE -->

<!-- INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPHS
Every paragraph needs a <p> and </p>. -->
<p>Begin the content of your article here.</p>

<!-- MAJOR HEADING and MORE CONTENT  
On all heading tags, no need to fill in refname, name, or alttoc. Production will handle.  -->
<heading refname="" type="major" toc="yes" name="" alttoc="">A succinct, lively heading</heading>
<p>Content continues. Use headings frequently to help the developer scan the article and quickly zero in on the content of interest.  Use sentence-style capitalization (only the first word is capitalized) on all headings.</p>

<p>
You can have several paragraphs under a heading.
</p>

<!-- MINOR HEADING and MORE CONTENT -->
<heading refname="" type="minor" toc="no" name="" alttoc="">A sub-heading of the previous heading</heading>
<p>This content is a sub-section of the previous content, and so its heading size is smaller.</p>

<!-- SIDEBAR 
Use sidebars for brief, tangential information. -->
<sidebar>
<heading refname="" type="sidebar" toc="no" name="" alttoc="">When to use sidebars</heading>
<p>Use a sidebar for content detours or reinforcement.</p> 
</sidebar>
<!-- END of SIDEBAR-->

<!-- THIRD-LEVEL HEADING and MORE CONTENT
If you need a third-level heading, simply use bold tagging and a break tag (br).-->
<p><b>A third-level heading</b>
<br />If you need a third-level heading, use the bold tags.
</p>

<!-- CODE IN A SENTENCE
type=inline is required. -->
<p>Programming elements (names of commands, methods, arguments, objects, for example) that occur in sentences should be in a monospace font.  For example, you might speak of the <code type="inline">fdisk</code> command or the <code type="inline">main()</code> method.</p>

<!-- CODE LISTING
type=section is required.  
You can include code listings at any point in the article.  Do not exceed the maximum width for code listings: 600 pixels or about 90 characters.  Include a caption for each code listing. 

Type or paste ASCII code into this file, with proper keyboard spacing.  Use the space key to indent lines. Use  &lt; to represent a less-than symbol and &gt; to represent a greater-than symbol.  Use &amp; for any use of ampersand.  If needed for clarity, use the bold tag for bolding text, as shown below. 

Do not place paragraph tags around the code section.  
 -->

<heading refname="" type="code" toc="no" name="" alttoc="">Listing 1. Caption that identifies the code sample</heading>
<code type="section">
\** This is sample code **\
Here is the first line of code
    Here is an indented line 
    Use the space key to indent lines.
    
line 50 #sample code cannot go........................beyond the end of this line
Here is the final line that includes some &lt;angle brackets&gt;

Add code here.  &lt;pre&gt; tags will be added automatically.
Use the b tag to surround <b>bolded code</b>.
</code>
<!-- END OF CODE SAMPLE -->

<!-- FIGURE 
Figures can appear anywhere in the body of the article.  Do not use paragraph tags around the figure.  The order of the tags is: figure, heading, img, as shown here. Figures should be in gif or jpg format, and no wider than 600 pixels. -->
<figure>	
<heading refname="" type="figure" toc="no" name="" alttoc="">Figure 1. Caption for sample figure</heading>
<img src="xxx.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="Caption for sample figure"/>
</figure>
<!-- END OF FIGURE -->

<p><b>Table heading</b>
<table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="1">
<tr >
<td><b>Heading A</b></td>
<td><b>Heading B</b></td>
<td><b>Heading C</b></td>

<tr >
