><P
>Some time ago, I went to a conference and was keen enough to setup a webcam to take a picture every couple of seconds. I then had 27,000 JPEG images, which I wanted to turn into a simple MPEG movie. This document details the process I went through to make this happen.</P

></H2
><P
>The version of this howto which you are currently reading is an update of the original version. I updated the document about a year after initially going through the process. This version reflects a few small changes in the open source projects which I used to perform the conversion, and some error corrections from the original version of this document.</P
><P
>Since the original version of this article, I have updated my machine from a pretty vanilla Redhat 7.1 box to a Debian unstable machine, for those who care about such things. Where things have changed from my experience about a year ago, I'll let you know.</P
><P
>I'm also a little surprised about the amount of email I have received about the original version of this document &mdash; obviously lots of people are trying to solve this kind of problem. I also get a lot of email from people using <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Microsoft Windows</SPAN
>&#8482; and wanting to perform a similar conversion. Unfortunately, as someone who doesn't use Windows very much, I cannot recommend a way of doing this sort of processing on that platform, although it is possible that MJPEG tools could be compiled for <SPAN

>4. MPEG tools</A
></H2
><P
>When I went searching for something to convert my many JPEG files to a MPEG moving, I quickly came across the MJPEG tools project. The URL for this project is http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net. MJPEG tools is very powerful, but there are lots of dependencies, which we should talk about first. There are also a few build and install problems with some of these dependencies which need to be resolved along the way, which I have also documented here. The updated version of this article was written with version 1.6.1 beta.</P

>The Netwide Assembler grew out of an idea on comp.lang.asm.x86 (or possibly alt.lang.asm - I forget which), which was essentially that there didn't seem to be a good free x86-series assembler around, and that maybe someone ought to write one.</P
><P

><UL
><LI
><P
>a86 is good, but not free, and in particular you don't get any 32-bit capability until you pay. It's DOS only, too.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>gas is free, and ports over DOS and Unix, but it's not very good, since it's designed to be a back end to gcc, which always feeds it correct code. So its error checking is minimal. Also, its syntax is horrible, from the point of view of anyone trying to actually write anything in it. Plus you can't write 16-bit code in it (properly).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>as86 is Minix- and Linux-specific, and (my version at least) doesn't seem to have much (or any) documentation.</P
></LI

><P
>MASM isn't very good, and it's expensive, and it runs only under DOS.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>TASM is better, but still strives for MASM compatibility, which means millions of directives and tons of red tape. And its syntax is essentially MASM's, with the contradictions and quirks that entails (although it sorts out some of those by means of Ideal mode). It's expensive too. And it's DOS-only.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>So here, for your coding pleasure, is NASM. At present it's still in prototype stage - we don't promise that it can outperform any of these assemblers. But please, please send us bug reports, fixes, helpful information, and anything else you can get your hands on (and thanks to the many people who've done this already! You all know who you are), and we'll improve it out of all recognition. Again.</P

>We'll also need the MJPEG people's MMX JPEG library, which was at version 0.1.4 at the time of writing this article. I believe the difference between the standard JPEG library and the MMX JPEG library is that the MMX version is optimized for MMX processors, and wont run on processors without MMX. The standard libjpeg also seems to be an option here, although my machine have MMX, so I didn't try it. I downloaded version 0.1.4, and did the autotools thing.</P
><P
>For some reason they have disabled the install make target, possibly because they're worried about clobbering the standard libjpeg install. This reason doesn't really work though, as the library files have different names from those used in libjpeg. I did:</P
