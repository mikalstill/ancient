This is a short description of the files in this module:

For each of the insertion and run dumps from SnoopyPro, there are three versions of the file:
 - the original data (*.usblog)
 - an XML rendition of the data (.xml)
 - a cleaned up version of the XML with time specific information removed
     (-fixed.xml)

There are currently three insertion and run dumps:

  ICM532-insertandrun-001-fixed.xml.gz
  ICM532-insertandrun-001.usblog.gz
  ICM532-insertandrun-001.xml.gz

  ICM532-insertandrun-002-fixed.xml.gz
  ICM532-insertandrun-002.usblog.gz
  ICM532-insertandrun-002.xml.gz

  ICM532-insertandrun-003-fixed.xml.gz
  ICM532-insertandrun-003.usblog.gz
  ICM532-insertandrun-003.xml.gz

I have also extracted a couple of the isochronous transfers in XML form for further analysis:

  isoch-001.xml
