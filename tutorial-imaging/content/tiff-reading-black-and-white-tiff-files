TITLE: TIFF -- Reading Black and White TIFF files

<li>As I said before, reliable reading is much harder than writing
<li>First let's talk about stripping, and tiling of images...

<li>Single strip is where all the image data is in one block (a strip)
<li>This can be unreliable if the strip is bigger than 8kb

<BR><BR>
<li>Multiple strip images have many horizontal strips
