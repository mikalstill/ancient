TITLE: TIFF: Reading a color image
<li>Now we just need to work out how to read color images in
<li>Here's why I'm not telling you about TIFFReadRGBAStrip() and TIFFReadRGBATile()

<BR><BR><i>
   TIFFReadRGBAStrip reads a single strip of a strip-based image into memory,
   storing  the  result  in  the  user supplied RGBA raster. The raster is assumed to be an array of
   width   times   rowsperstrip   32-bit   entries,   where   width   is  the  width  of  the  image
   (TIFFTAG_IMAGEWIDTH) and rowsperstrip is the maximum lines in a strip (TIFFTAG_ROWSPERSTRIP).
</i>

<BR><BR><i>
   The  strip  value  should  be  the  strip  number  (strip  zero  is the first) as returned by the
   TIFFComputeStrip function, but always for sample 0.
</i>

<BR><BR><i>
   Note  that  the  raster  is  assume  to  be  organized  such  that the pixel at location (x,y) is
   raster[y*width+x];  with  the  raster  origin in the lower-left hand corner of the strip. That is
   bottom  to  top  organization. When reading a partial last strip in the file the last line of the
   image will begin at the beginning of the buffer.
