TITLE: TIFF: Coding for TIFF can be hard
<li>Most file formats lay down basic rules covering:
  <ul>


  <li>The byte order -- big endian, or little endian
  <li>The fill order of the bit within the image bytes -- most significant bit first, or least significant
  <li>The meaning of a given pixel value for black and white -- is 0 black, or white?
  <li>...and so on


  </ul>
<li>TIFF doesn't

<li>This makes it very easy to create TIFFs
<li>Your current internal format is probably good enough
<li>Very hard to read in TIFF files well however

<br><br>
<li><i>Try to avoid making assumptions...</i>
