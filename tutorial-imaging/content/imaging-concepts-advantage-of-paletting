TITLE: Imaging concepts -- The advantage of paletting

<li>A4 page = 1754 x 2479 pixels = 4,348,166 pixels
<li>Assume 24 bit color (8 bits for each of R, G, and B)
<li>Assume 7 colors in the image (3 bits for the palette index)
<li>Unpaletted: 4,348,166 * 24 bits = 13,044,498 bytes (uncompressed)
<li>Paletted: 4,348,166 * 3 bits = 1,630,562 bytes (uncompressed)
  <ul>
  <li>Plus the size of the palette: 7 * 24 bits = 21 bytes
  </ul>
