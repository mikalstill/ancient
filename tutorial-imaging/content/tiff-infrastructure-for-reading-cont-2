TITLE: TIFF -- Infrastructure for reading (continued)

<li>What is photometric interpretation?
<li>It's the representation of the image in the raster
<BR><BR>
<li>For example, I might code my bitmaps so black is represented by 1
<li>... you might use 0 for black
<li>TIFF allows both in the TIFFTAG_PHOTOMETRIC tag
  <ul>
  <li>PHOTOMETRIC_MINISWHITE
  <li>PHOTOMETRIC_MINISBLACK
  </ul>
<BR><BR>
<li>In the examples here I have assumed we need PHOTOMETRIC_MINISWHITE, so we will convert PHOTOMETRIC_MINISBLACK as required.
