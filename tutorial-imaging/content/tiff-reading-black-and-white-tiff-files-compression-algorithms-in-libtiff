<td>CCITT Group 4 Fax and Group 3 Fax</td>
<td>If your coding for black and white images, then you're probably using the CCITT fax compression methods. These compression algorithms don't support color.</td>

<td>JPEG</td>
<td>JPEG compression is great for large images such as photos. However, the compression is normally lossy (in that image data is thrown away as part of the compression process). This makes JPEG very poor for compressing text which needs to remain readable. The other thing to bear in mind is that the loss is accumulative -- see the loss section below for more information about this.</td>

<tr>
<td>LZW</td>
<td><i>This is the compression algorithm used in GIF images. Because of the licensing requirements from Unisys, support for this compression codec has been removed from libtiff. There are patches available if you would like to add it back, but the majority of programs your code will integrate with no linger support LZW.</i></td>

<td>Deflate</td>
<td>This is the gzip compression algorithm, which is also used for PNG. It is the compression algorithm I would recommend for color images.</td>
