TITLE: TIFF: Writing Black and White TIFF files: Writing the image: Continued 1
<li>Things to note from this example:
  <ul>


<li>The buffers presented to and returned from libtiff each contain 8 pixels in a single byte. This means that you have to be able to extract the pixels you are interested in. The use of masks, and the right and left shift operators come in handy here.

<li>The TIFFOpen function is very similar to the fopen function we are all familiar with.

<li>We need to set the value for quite a few fields before we can start writing the image out. These fields give libtiff information about the size and shape of the image, as well as the way that data will be compressed within the image. These fields need to be set before you can start handing image data to libtiff. There are many more fields for which a value could be set, I have used close to the bar minimum in this example.

<li>TIFFWriteEncodedStrip is the function call which actually inserts the image into the file. This call inserts uncompressed image data into the file. This means that libtiff will compress the image data for you before writing it to the file. If you have already compressed data, then have a look at the TIFFWriteRawStrip instead.

<li>Finally, we close the file with TIFFClose.


  </ul>
