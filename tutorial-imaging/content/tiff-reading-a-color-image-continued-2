TITLE: TIFF: Reading a color image: Continued 2
<li>So what's wrong with this function?
  <ul>
  <li>It defines the origin (0,0) in a different way from <b>all</b> the other libtiff calls
  <li>Not all valid values for bits per sample are handled
  </ul>

<BR><BR>

<li>We're going to use it anyway, because it makes the code clearer...
<li>Remember that you can always use TIFFReadEncodedStrip() like we did for the black and white images -- although you then have to interpret the image data yourself
