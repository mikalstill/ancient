TITLE: TIFF: Storing TIFF data in places other than files
<li>There are times when it isn't appropriate to store your image data in files
<li>There are lots of examples of when you might want to put the data in a database instead
<li>Perhaps the image data is going to be embedded into another file format

<BR><BR>
<li>The example I am most familiar with is the PDF specification
<li>The PDF format is basically ASCII (as we will see later)
<li>But has embedded binary "streams" such as TIFF data
<li>So we would like to be able to create these streams with libtiff
<li>...instead of having to implement our own TIFF library
