TITLE: Imaging concepts: Gray scale conversion
<li>How do you convert color images to grayscale?
<li>Well, most people (including myself) just start off by averaging the red, green and blue color values for each pixel
<li>This is not optimal...
<li>Because your eye is much more sensitive to green than blue for instance
<BR><BR>
<li>The NSTC folk dealt with this, and propose the following coefficients...
  <ul>
  <li>Red: 0.299
  <li>Green: 0.587
  <li>Blue: 0.114
  </ul>
