TITLE: TIFF: Other values for samples per pixel?: Continued 1
<li>The other interesting thing we should talk about now is planar configuration
<li>You don't have to have your image data grouped like:

<pre>
RGBRGBRGBRGBRGB
</pre>

<li>Grouping all the red samples together is equally valid, for instance:

<pre>
RRRRRGGGGGBBBBB
</pre>

<li>Have a look at the libtiff documentation on TIFFTAG_PLANARCONFIG for more details
