We have now mentioned the global color table, but haven't defined what it actually means. Don't panic, we'll get there in just a second.

<BR><BR><b>Formula for global color table size</b>
<BR><BR>
To determine the size of the of the global color table, simply apply this formula: <i>size of global color table = 2 ^ (size in table + 1)</i>. The maximum size of the global color table is therefore <i>2 ^ (7 + 1)</i>, or 255 items.



<pre>
size of global color table = 2 ^ (size in table + 1)
</pre>

<li>The maximum size is therefore:

<pre>
2 ^ (7 + 1)
</pre>

<li>Which is 255 items
<li>There will actually be three times that number of color bytes in the global color table
<li>... Because colors are 24 bit per pixel

<BR><BR>
There will actually be three times that number of color bytes in the global color table, because each color is 24 bit per pixel.

If the logical screen block of the image specified that a global color table is present in the image, then this is the next part of the GIF data stream. The global color table is a palette -- in other words, it maps the values actually stored in the image data to the 24 bit values which are the colors.

<li>The global color table is a palette
<li>The format is very simple
  <ul>
  <li>Just the red, green and blue values

The format of the global color table is very simple, it is simply the red, green and blue values stored without any header or footer.
