TITLE: TIFF: Reading a color image: Continued 1
<BR><BR><i>
   Raster  pixels  are  8-bit packed red, green, blue, alpha samples. The macros TIFFGetR, TIFFGetG,
   TIFFGetB,  and  TIFFGetA  should  be used to access individual samples. Images without Associated
   Alpha matting information have a constant Alpha of 1.0 (255).

<BR><BR><i>
   See  the TIFFRGBAImage(3T) page for more details on how various image types are converted to RGBA
   values.

<i><b>NOTES</b></i>

<BR><BR><i>
   Samples must be either 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bits. Colorimetric samples/pixel must be either 1, 3, or
   4 (i.e. SamplesPerPixel minus ExtraSamples).
</i>

<BR><BR><i>
   Palette  image  colormaps that appear to be incorrectly written as 8-bit values are automatically
   scaled to 16-bits.

   TIFFReadRGBAStrip  is  just  a wrapper around the more general TIFFRGBAImage(3T) facilities. It's
   main  advantage  over  the similar TIFFReadRGBAImage() function is that for large images a single
   buffer  capable  of  holding  the  whole  image doesn't need to be allocated, only enough for one
   strip. The TIFFReadRGBATile() function does a similar operation for tiled images.
