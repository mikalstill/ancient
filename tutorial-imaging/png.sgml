<para>
PNG is my favourite image format after TIFF. It is well conceived, well implemented, and very powerful. It also has some interesting features, mainly aimed at Internet use, which TIFF lacks. It is also usable in modern web browsers

, unlike TIFF. PNG is also much simpler in many respects than TIFF.

A bunch of the examples in this chapter are based on the pngitools code I wrote a while ago, which I have updated as part of writing this chapter.

Much of the discussion in this chapter will make a whole bunch more sense if you've read the TIFF chapter. Off you go, I'll wait for you to come back...

<para>
The <command>pnginfo</command> command implemented here is modelled on the <command>tiffinfo</command>, which was discussed in the TIFF chapter earlier in this tutorial. In fact, the output text is written to be as close to the <command>tiffinfo</command> command as possible.
