How do you convert color images to gray scale? Well, my instant answer when I first had to do this was to just average the red, green and blue values. That answer is wrong. The reality is that the human eye is much better at seeing some colors than others. To get an accurate gray scale representation, you need to apply different coefficients to the color samples. Appropriate coefficients are 0.299 for red, 0.587 for green and 0.114 for blue.

<li>How do you convert color images to grayscale?
<li>Well, most people (including myself) just start off by averaging the red, green and blue color values for each pixel
<li>This is not optimal...
<li>Because your eye is much more sensitive to green than blue for instance

<li>The NSTC folk dealt with this, and propose the following coefficients...
  <ul>
  <li>Red: 0.299
  <li>Green: 0.587
  <li>Blue: 0.114
  </ul>

Below I have included several pictures that illustrate this concept. The first figure is a color image
  <footnote><para>Which may or may not give you joy, depending on if you are viewing this document in color or not</para></footnote>
, the second is the color image converted to gray scale without the coefficients applied, and the third image is a correct gray scale rendition.

You can see that the sensible algorithm is better, have a look at the shadows on the hill and the trees in the background. The contrast and darkness of the second picture is might better than the averaging algorithm...

The source code to generate these example images may be found in the TIFF chapter.
