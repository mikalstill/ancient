<chapter id="chap-introduction"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>
This document is the manual associated with my tutorial on imaging programming presented at the <emphasis>Australian Unix User's Group</emphasis> 2002 Winter Conference in Melbourne Australia. It is intended to serve as the basis for discussions during this day long tutorial, as well as being a reference for the attendees once they return to their every day lives.

<title>About the author</title>
<para>
Michael has been working in the image processing field for several years, including a couple of years managing and developing large image databases for an Australian government department. He currently works for TOWER Software, who manufacture a world leading EDMS and Records Management package named TRIM. Michael is also the developer of Panda, an open source PDF generation API, as well as being the maintainer of the comp.text.pdf USENET frequently asked questions document. You can contact Michael at mikal@stillhq.com.

<para>
Michael also has a whole bunch of code (most of which relates to imaging) at his website: http://www.stillhq.com

<sect1><title>Motivation for this tutorial</title>
<para>
This tutorial started life as a series of articles about the TIFF image format, which were published by IBM DeveloperWorks (http://www.ibm.com/developerworks) in April and June 2002. This logically grew into the tutorial you see before you today. This tutorial is based on my several years experience as an imaging developer, and the common mistakes that people seem to make over and over. Perhaps this tutorial will go some way to correcting some common misconceptions.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>Assumed knowledge</title>
<para>
There are some things which I assume you know, and which are outside the scope of this tutorial.
</para>

<sect2><title>C</title>
<para>
This tutorial discusses code. Almost all of the code discussed is written in C. It is therefore safe to assume that if you don't have a good working knowledge of C, then you're likely to get a lot less out of this tutorial as those who do know some C. On the other hand, don't worry about the more esoteric syntax, I'll explain this as we need it.
</para>

<para>
It should also be noted that the code samples in this tutorial are not optimal. They have been written to be as readable as possible, and not nessesarily the most efficient possible. Please bear this in mind before blindly copying them.

<sect2><title>How to compile and link on your chosen operating system</title>
<para>
It is outside the scope of this document to teach you how to compile and link source code into an executable form on your chosen architecture and operating system. You will need to understand this before you will be able to use any of the code in this document.
</para>

<para>
For those of you using gcc on a unix (or unix-like) operating system, then the following points might be all you need to know. If you need more information, then a http://www.google.com search will serve you well.

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Libraries are added to the link command using the -l command line option. For instance, to compile and link the source file foo, with the tiff library, you would use a command line along the lines of <command>gcc foo.c -o foo -ltiff -lm</command>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>You need to include -lm almost always. When you compile a c program using gcc without specifying any libraries, you get a -lm for free. As soon as you start specifying any libraries (for instance in this case -ltiff), then you also need to explicitly specify the math library as well.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>You will almost certainly also need to add the library and include paths for the installed version of the relevant library to the compile command line as well. Directories are added to the library search path using the -L command line option. Include directories are added with the -I option.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The makefiles included with the samples in this tutorial a probably a bad place to look for introductory compile examples, as they use automake and autoconf to try to detect where the various required libraries are installed...</para></listitem>

<para>
This tutorial was written in Docbook SGML using xemacs. This was then converted into PDF using the jade SGML tools. Diagrams were developed in a combination of the gimp, Adobe Illustrator, and custom developed code. Diagrams were converted to EPS as required by jade using ImageMagick.

There are some core terms which are used throughout this tutorial. This section defines these terms -- it's probably therefore worth bookmarking this section for reference throughout the rest of the day. This section presents these things in alphabetical order, for ease of reference.
</para>

<sect1>
<title>Terminology</title>
<para>	
We need to get some terminology out of the way before we can discuss much. Images are made up of pixels. In black and white imaging, the pixel has one of two values -- 0 or 1. This can be represented in a single bit. For grayscale and color images however, the pixel needs to be able to store a much greater range of values -- if a pixel was to have 255 levels of gray, then we would need 8 bits to store that pixel. Each of these values is called a sample. TIFF expresses the size of the value in a tag called TIFFTAG_BITSPERSAMPLE. This will be 1 for black and white, and some larger number for grayscale.
</para>

<para>
For color images, we need to store even more information. For each pixel we will need to store a red, green, and blue value. Each of these values are stored in a separate 'sample'. Therefore, we will need to define TIFFTAG_SAMPLESPERPIXEL -- this will be 1 for black and white or grayscale, but will normally be 3 for color images. We also need to define the size of each sample, so you'll still need to set a value for TIFFTAG_BITSPERSAMPLE.

<chapter id="chap-imagetheory"><title>Imaging theory</title>
<sect1><title>Theory of color and grayscale storage</title>
<para>
The first thing that we need to understand to be able to support color and grayscale images is the format of the image data within memory. There are two main representations for color and grayscale images. I'll explain these by describing grayscale, and then extend it to color.
</para>

<sect2><title>Direct storage of pixel data</title>
<para>
If you think back to the way pixel information was stored in the black and white images from the previous article, the information was just in the strips. You can also do this with grayscale and color images. This representation of image data is quite inefficient, because for the scenario when the image has a solid background (for example), there are many pixels with the same value. If the pixel data is stored in the strips, then this value will waste a large amount of space.
</para>

<para>
Thankfully, there is a more efficient way to store image data. Imagine a simple four color 24 bit per pixel image. If we build a lookup table of the four color values (the 24 bit values which represent those colors), then we just need to store the relevant entry number of the color in the image strip itself. This can be done in only two bits, instead of the full 24. The maths looks something like this:
</para>

<para>
A 24 bit color image which is 1,000 by 1,000 pixels will take 24 million bits to store. The same image, if it was a four color image, would take 4,000,000 bits for the strip data, and 98 bits for the color table. Neither of these numbers includes header and footer information for the file format, and the numbers are for uncompressed bitmaps. The advantages of the lookup table should be obvious. There is a name for this style of lookup table, it is called a <emphasis>palette</emphasis> -- probably because of those things painters carry around.
</para>

<para>
This concept works for grayscale images as well. The only difference is that the colors in the palette are not just shades of gray.

</para>

<para>
In this chapter we will discuss the Tagged Image File Format, which is one of the most common raster image formats for professional imaging -- especially scanned images and faxes. Unfortunately, it is not supported by web browsers, so isn't used as much as it might otherwise be.
</para>

<sect1><title>Introduction</title>
<para>
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a raster image format which was originally produced by Aldus and Microsoft. Aldus was later acquired by Adobe, who manage the TIFF specification to this day. At the time of writing of this chapter, the current version of the TIFF specification is TIFF version 6.0. The TIFF specification can be downloaded from http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/TIFF6.pdf. The TIFF technical notes at http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/technotes/main.html
</para>

<para>Libtiff is a standard implementation of the TIFF specification, which is free and works on many operating systems. All of the examples in this chapter refer to libtiff.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>Installation</title>
<para>
The source for libtiff can be downloaded from http://www.libtiff.org/ -- the current version of the library being version 3.5.7 at the time of writing. This version can be downloaded from ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/libtiff, look for the files named either tiff-v3.5.7.tar.gz or tiff-v3.5.7.zip.
</para>

<sect2><title>Unix</title>

Sign is implemented using two's complement notation. New field types may be added later, although it seems unlikely at this stage, given the TIFF specification hasn't changed in quite a long time. Image readers should ignore types they don't understand

</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Possible field entries</title>
<para>
Discussing the many different possible field entries is out of the scope of this document. Refer to tiff.h and the TIFF specification for more information.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>So where's the image data?</title>
<para>
Interestingly, the image data itself is just stored as another tag value... The tag value StripOffsets stores where in the file the image data strips start. The tag value StripByteCounts stores the size of each strip.
</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>


<sect1><title>Coding for TIFF can be hard</title>
<para>	
Most file format specifications define some basic rules for the representation of the file. For instance, PNG (a competitor to TIFF) documents are always big endian. TIFF doesn't mandate things like this though, here is a list of some of the seemingly basic things that it doesn't define:

<orderedlist>
  <listitem><para>The byte order -- big endian, or little endian</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>The fill order of the bit within the image bytes -- most significant bit first, or least significant</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>The meaning of a given pixel value for black and white -- is 0 black, or white?</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>...and so on</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<para>
This means that creating a TIFF can be very easy, because it is rare to have to do any conversion of the data that you already have. It does mean, on the other hand, that being able to read in random TIFFs created by other applications can be very hard -- you have to code for all these possible combinations in order to be reasonably certain of having a reliable product.
</para>
	
<para>
So how do you write an application which can read in all these different possible permutations of the TIFF format? The most important thing to remember is to <emphasis>never make assumptions about the format of the image data you are reading in</emphasis>.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>Writing Black and White TIFF files</title>
<para>
The first thing I want to do is show you how to write a TIFF file out. We'll then get onto how to read a TIFF file back into your program.
</para>
	
<sect2><title>Infrastructure for writing</title>
<para>
It is traditional for bitmaps to be represented inside your code with an array of chars. This is because on most operating systems, a char maps well to one byte. In the block of code below, we will setup libtiff, and create a simple buffer which contains an image which we can then write out to disc.
</para>

<programlisting>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;

int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char buffer[32 * 9];
}
</programlisting>
<para><emphasis>Code: /home/mikal/opensource/tiff-bw-write/write-infrastructure.c</emphasis></para>

<para>
The code above is pretty simple. All you need to use libtiff is to include the tiffio.h header file. The char buffer that we have defined here is going to be our black and white image, so we should define one of those next...
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Writing the image</title>
<para>
To make up for how boring that example was, I am now pleased to present you with possibly the worst picture of the Sydney Harbor Bridge ever drawn. In the example below, the image is already in the image buffer, and all we have to do is save it to the file on disc. The example first opens a TIFF image in write mode, and then places the image into that file.
</para>

<para>
Please note, that for clarity I have omitted the actual hex for the image, this is available in the download version of this code for those who are interested.
</para>

<programlisting>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
  // Define an image -- this is 32 pixels by 9 pixels
  char buffer[25 * 144] = { ...boring hex omitted... };

  TIFF *image;

  // Open the TIFF file
  if((image = TIFFOpen("output.tif", "w")) == NULL){
    printf("Could not open output.tif for writing\n");
    exit(42);
  }

  // We need to set some values for basic tags before we can add any data
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_IMAGEWIDTH, 25 * 8);
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_IMAGELENGTH, 144);
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_BITSPERSAMPLE, 1);
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_SAMPLESPERPIXEL, 1);
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_ROWSPERSTRIP, 144);

  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_COMPRESSION, COMPRESSION_CCITTFAX4);
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_PHOTOMETRIC, PHOTOMETRIC_MINISWHITE);
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_FILLORDER, FILLORDER_MSB2LSB);
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_PLANARCONFIG, PLANARCONFIG_CONTIG);

  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_XRESOLUTION, 150.0);
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_YRESOLUTION, 150.0);
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_RESOLUTIONUNIT, RESUNIT_INCH);
  
  // Write the information to the file
  TIFFWriteEncodedStrip(image, 0, buffer, 25 * 144);

  // Close the file
  TIFFClose(image);
}
</programlisting>

<para>
There are some interesting things to note in this example. The most interesting of these is that the output image will not display using the xview command on my Linux machine. In fact, I couldn't find an example of a group 4 fax compressed black and white image which would display using that program. See the sidebar for more detail.

It's a good example of how hard it can be to handle TIFF images well. If you have trouble viewing the output of the sample code, then try using some other program, like the GIMP.
</para>
</sidebar>

<para>
The sample code shows the basics of using the libtiff API. The following interesting points should be noted...
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>The buffers presented to and returned from libtiff each contain 8 pixels in a single byte. This means that you have to be able to extract the pixels you are interested in. The use of masks, and the right and left shift operators come in handy here.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The TIFFOpen function is very similar to the fopen function we are all familiar with.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>We need to set the value for quite a few fields before we can start writing the image out. These fields give libtiff information about the size and shape of the image, as well as the way that data will be compressed within the image. These fields need to be set before you can start handing image data to libtiff. There are many more fields for which a value could be set, I have used close to the bar minimum in this example.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>TIFFWriteEncodedStrip is the function call which actually inserts the image into the file. This call inserts uncompressed image data into the file. This means that libtiff will compress the image data for you before writing it to the file. If you have already compressed data, then have a look at the TIFFWriteRawStrip instead.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Finally, we close the file with TIFFClose.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<sidebar>
<title>More information about the libtiff function calls</title>
<para>
If you need more information about any of the libtiff function calls mentioned in this chapter, then checkout the extensive man pages which come with the library. Remember that case is important with man pages, so you need to get the case in the function names right -- it's TIFFOpen, not tiffopen.

<sect1><title>Reading Black and White TIFF files</title>
<para>
Reading TIFF files reliably is much harder than writing them. The issue that complicates reading black and white TIFF images the most is the several different storage schemes which are possible within the TIFF file itself. libtiff doesn't hold your hand much with these schemes, so you have to be able to handle them yourself. The three schemes TIFF supports are single stripped images, stripped images, and tiled images.
</para>

Tiled images are comparatively uncommon, so I will focus on stripped images in this chapter. Remember as we go along, that the single stripped case is merely a subset of a multiple strip images.

<sect2><title>Infrastructure for reading</title>
<para>
The most important thing to remember when reading in TIFF images is to be flexible. The example below has the same basic concepts as the writing example above, with the major difference being that it needs to deal with many possible input images. Apart from stripping and tiling, the most important thing to remember to be flexible about is photo metric interpretation. Luckily, with black and white images there are only two photo metric interpretations to worry about (with color and to a certain extent gray scale images there are many more).
</para>

<para>
What is photo metric interpretation? Well, the representation of the image in the buffer is really a very arbitrary thing. I might code my bitmaps so that 0 means black (TIFFTAG_MINISBLACK), whilst you might find black being 1 (TIFFTAG_MINISWHITE) more convenient. TIFF allows both, so our code has to be able to handle both cases. In the example below, I have assumed that the internal buffers need to be in MINISWHITE, so we will convert images which are in MINISBLACK.
</para>

<para>
The other big thing to bear in mind is fill order (whether the first bit in the byte is the highest value, or the lowest). The example below also handles both of these correctly. I have assumed that we want the buffer to have the most significant bit first. TIFF images can be either big endian or little endian, but libtiff handles this for us. Thankfully, libtiff also supports the various compression algorithms without you having to worry about those. These are by far the scariest area of TIFF, so it is still worth your time to use libtiff.

<para>
This code works by first opening the image and checking that it is one that we can handle. It then reads in all the strip for the image, and appends them together in one large memory block. If required, it also flips bits until the photo metric interpretation the one we handle, and deals with having to swap bits if the fill order is wrong. Finally, our sample outputs the image as a series of lines composed of hex values. Remember that each of the values represents 8 pixels in the actual image.

<sect2><title>Accumulating loss?</title>
<para>Why does the loss in lossy compression algorithms such as JPEG accumulate? Imagine that you compress an image using JPEG. You then need to add say a bar code to the image, so you uncompress the image, add the bar code, and recompress it. When the recompression occurs, then a new set of loss is introduced. You can imagine that if you do this enough, then you'll end up with an image which is a big blob.</para>

<para>Whether this is a problem depends on the type of your data. To test how much of a problem this is, I wrote a simple libtiff program which repeatedly uncompresses and recompresses an image. What I found was that with pictures, the data is much more resilient to repeated compression.</para>

<para><emphasis>Code: /home/mikal/opensource/tiff-color-write/write.c</emphasis></para>

<para>You can see from this code some of the things that we have discussed in theory. The image has three samples per pixel, each of eight bits. This means that the image is a 24 bit RGB image. If this was a black and white or gray scale image, then this value would be one. The tag PHOTOMETRIC_RGB says that the image data is stored within the strips themselves (as opposed to being paletted) -- more about this in a second.</para>

<sidebar><title>Other values for samples per pixel?</title>
<para>
In this example, we have three samples per pixel. If this was a black and white image, or a gray scale image, then we would have one sample per pixel. There are other valid values for here as well -- for instance, sometimes people will store a transparency value for a given pixel, which is called an alpha channel. This would result in having four samples per pixel. It is possible to have an arbitrary number of samples per pixel, which is good if you need to pack in extra information about a pixel. <emphasis>Note that doing this can break image viewers which make silly assumptions -- I once had to write code for a former employer to strip out alpha channels and the like so that their PDF generator wouldn't crash.</emphasis>
</para>
</sidebar>

<para>The other interesting thing to discuss here is the planar configuration of the image. Here we have specified PLANARCONFIG_CONTIG, which means that the red green and blue information for a given pixel is grouped together in the strips of image data. The other option is PLANARCONFIG_SEPARATE, where the red samples for the image are stored together, then the blue samples, and finally the green samples.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>Writing a paletted color image</title>
<para>
So how do we write a paletted version of this image? Well, libtiff makes this really easy -- all we need to do is change the value of TIFFTAG_PHOTOMETRIC to PHOTOMETRIC_PALETTE. It's not really worth including an example in this chapter, given it's a one word change.</para>
</sect1>





<sect1><title>Reading a color image</title>
<para>
Now all we have to do is work out how to read other people's color and gray scale images reliably, and we're home free. Initially I was very tempted to not tell you about the TIFFReadRGBAStrip() and TIFFReadRGBBSTile() calls, which hide some of the potential ugliness from the caller. These functions have some limitations I'm not astoundingly happy with. To quote the TIFFReadRGBAStrip() man page:</para>

<para><emphasis>
   TIFFReadRGBAStrip reads a single strip of a strip-based image into memory,
   storing  the  result  in  the  user supplied RGBA raster. The raster is assumed to be an array of
   width   times   rowsperstrip   32-bit   entries,   where   width   is  the  width  of  the  image
   (TIFFTAG_IMAGEWIDTH) and rowsperstrip is the maximum lines in a strip (TIFFTAG_ROWSPERSTRIP).
</emphasis></para>

<para><emphasis>
   The  strip  value  should  be  the  strip  number  (strip  zero  is the first) as returned by the
   TIFFComputeStrip function, but always for sample 0.
</emphasis></para>

<para><emphasis>
   Note  that  the  raster  is  assume  to  be  organized  such  that the pixel at location (x,y) is
   raster[y*width+x];  with  the  raster  origin in the lower-left hand corner of the strip. That is
   bottom  to  top  organization. When reading a partial last strip in the file the last line of the
   image will begin at the beginning of the buffer.
</emphasis></para>

<para><emphasis>
   Raster  pixels  are  8-bit packed red, green, blue, alpha samples. The macros TIFFGetR, TIFFGetG,
   TIFFGetB,  and  TIFFGetA  should  be used to access individual samples. Images without Associated
   Alpha matting information have a constant Alpha of 1.0 (255).
</emphasis></para>

<para><emphasis>
   See  the TIFFRGBAImage(3T) page for more details on how various image types are converted to RGBA
   values.

</emphasis></para>

<para><emphasis>
   Samples must be either 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bits. Colorimetric samples/pixel must be either 1, 3, or
   4 (i.e. SamplesPerPixel minus ExtraSamples).
</emphasis></para>

<para><emphasis>
   Palette  image  colormaps that appear to be incorrectly written as 8-bit values are automatically
   scaled to 16-bits.
</emphasis></para>

<para><emphasis>
   TIFFReadRGBAStrip  is  just  a wrapper around the more general TIFFRGBAImage(3T) facilities. It's
   main  advantage  over  the similar TIFFReadRGBAImage() function is that for large images a single
   buffer  capable  of  holding  the  whole  image doesn't need to be allocated, only enough for one
   strip. The TIFFReadRGBATile() function does a similar operation for tiled images.
</emphasis></para>

<para>There are a couple of odd things about this function -- it defines (0, 0) to be in a different location from all the other code that we have been writing. In all the previous code we have written, the (0, 0) point has been in the top left of the image. This call defines (0, 0) to be in the bottom left. The other limitation to be aware of is that not all valid values for bits per sample are supported. If you find these quirks unacceptable, then remember that you can still use TIFFReadEncodedStrip() in the same manner that we did for the black and white images in the previous chapter...</para>

<sect1><title>Storing TIFF data in places other than files</title>
<para>
All of these examples that I have included to this point have read and written with files. There are many scenarios when you wouldn't want to store your image data in a file, but would still want to use libtiff and TIFF. For example, you might have customer pictures for id cards, and these would be stored in a database.
</para>

<para>
The example which I am most familiar with is PDF documents. In PDF files, you can embed images into the document. These images can be in a subset of TIFF if desired, and TIFF is quite clearly the choice for black and white images.

<sect3><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para><emphasis>tiff2ps</emphasis>
reads
<emphasis>TIFF</emphasis>
images and writes \*(Ps or Encapsulated \*(Ps (EPS)
on the standard output.
By default,
<emphasis>tiff2ps</emphasis>
writes Encapsulated \*(Ps for the first image in the specified
<emphasis>TIFF</emphasis>
image file.
</para>

<para>By default,
<emphasis>tiff2ps</emphasis>
will generate \*(Ps that fills a printed area specified
by the
<emphasis>TIFF</emphasis>
tags in the input file.
If the file does not contain
<emphasis>XResolution</emphasis>
or
<emphasis>YResolution</emphasis>
tags, then the printed area is set according to the image dimensions.
The
<command>-w</command>
and
<command>-h</command>
options (see below)
can be used to set the dimensions of the printed area in inches;
overriding any relevant
<emphasis>TIFF</emphasis>
tags.
</para>

<para>The \*(Ps generated for
<emphasis>RGB,</emphasis>
palette, and
<emphasis>CMYK</emphasis>
images uses the
<emphasis>colorimage</emphasis>
operator.
The \*(Ps generated for
greyscale and bilevel images
uses the
<emphasis>image</emphasis>
operator.
When the
<emphasis>colorimage</emphasis>
operator is used, \*(Ps code to emulate this operator
on older \*(Ps printers is also generated.
Note that this emulation code can be very slow.

When generating \*(Ps Level II, data is scaled so that it does not
image into the
<emphasis>deadzone</emphasis>
on a page (the outer margin that the printing device is unable to mark).
This option suppresses this behaviour.
When \*(Ps Level I is generated, data is imaged to the entire printed

<para>The following generates \*(Ps Level II for all pages of a facsimile:
tiff2ps -a2 fax.tif | lpr
Note also that if you have version 2.6.1 or newer of Ghostscript then you
can efficiently preview facsimile generated with the above command.
</para>

<para>To generate Encapsulated \*(Ps for a the image at directory 2
of an image use:
tiff2ps -d 1 foo.tif
(notice that directories are numbered starting at zero.)
</para>
</sect3>
<sect3><title>BUGS</title>

<para>Because \*(Ps does not support the notion of a colormap,
8-bit palette images produce 24-bit \*(Ps images.
This conversion results in output that is six times
bigger than the original image and which takes a long time
to send to a printer over a serial line.
Matters are even worse for 4-, 2-, and 1-bit palette images.

</sect3>
<sect3><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para><emphasis>tiffcp</emphasis>
combines one or more files created according
to the Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0
into a single
<emphasis>TIFF</emphasis>
file.
Because the output file may be compressed using a different
algorithm than the input files,
<emphasis>tiffcp</emphasis>
is most often used to convert between different compression
schemes.
</para>

<para>By default,
<emphasis>tiffcp</emphasis>
will copy all the understood tags in a
<emphasis>TIFF</emphasis>
directory of an input
file to the associated directory in the output file.
</para>

<para><emphasis>tiffcp</emphasis>
can be used to reorganize the storage characteristics of data
in a file, but it is explicitly intended to not alter or convert
the image data content in any way.
</para>
</sect3>
<sect3><title>OPTIONS</title>

<para></para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<para><command>-B</command>
Force output to be written with Big-Endian byte order.
This option only has an effect when the output file is created or
overwritten and not when it is appended to.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para><command>-C</command>
Suppress the use of ``strip chopping'' when reading images
that have a single strip/tile of uncompressed data.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para><command>-c</command>
Specify the compression to use for data written to the output file:
<command>none </command>
for no compression,
<command>packbits</command>
for PackBits compression,
<command>lzw</command>
for Lempel-Ziv &amp; Welch compression,
<command>jpeg</command>
for baseline JPEG compression,
<command>zip</command>
for Deflate compression,
<command>g3</command>
for CCITT Group 3 (T.4) compression,
and
<command>g4</command>
for CCITT Group 4 (T.6) compression.
By default
<emphasis>tiffcp</emphasis>
will compress data according to the value of the
<emphasis>Compression</emphasis>
tag found in the source file.
The
<emphasis>CCITT</emphasis>
Group 3 and Group 4 compression algorithms can only
be used with bilevel data.
Group 3 compression can be specified together with several
T.4-specific options:
<command>1d</command>
for 1-dimensional encoding,
<command>2d</command>
for 2-dimensional encoding,
and
<command>fill</command>
to force each encoded scanline to be zero-filled so that the
terminating EOL code lies on a byte boundary.
Group 3-specific options are specified by appending a ``:''-separated
list to the ``g3'' option; e.g.
<command>"-c g3:2d:fill"</command>
to get 2D-encoded data with byte-aligned EOL codes.
<emphasis>LZW</emphasis>
compression can be specified together with a
<emphasis>predictor</emphasis>
value.
A predictor value of 2 causes
each scanline of the output image to undergo horizontal
differencing before it is encoded; a value
of 1 forces each scanline to be encoded without differencing.
LZW-specific options are specified by appending a ``:''-separated
list to the ``lzw'' option; e.g.
<command>"-c lzw:2"</command>
for
<emphasis>LZW</emphasis>
compression with horizontal differencing.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para><command>-f</command>
Specify the bit fill order to use in writing output data.
By default,
<emphasis>tiffcp</emphasis>
will create a new file with the same fill order as the original.
Specifying
<command>"-f lsb2msb"</command>
will force data to be written with the FillOrder tag set to
<emphasis>LSB2MSB,</emphasis>
while
<command>"-f msb2lsb"</command>
will force data to be written with the FillOrder tag set to
<emphasis>MSB2LSB.</emphasis>
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para><command>-l</command>
Specify the length of a tile (in pixels).
<emphasis>tiffcp</emphasis>
attempts to set the tile dimensions so
that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a tile.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para><command>-L</command>
Force output to be written with Little-Endian byte order.
This option only has an effect when the output file is created or
overwritten and not when it is appended to.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para><command>-M</command>
Suppress the use of memory-mapped files when reading images.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para><command>-p</command>
Specify the planar configuration to use in writing image data
that has one 8-bit sample per pixel.
By default,
<emphasis>tiffcp</emphasis>
will create a new file with the same planar configuration as
the original.
Specifying
<command>"-p contig"</command>
will force data to be written with multi-sample data packed
together, while
<command>"-p separate"</command>
will force samples to be written in separate planes.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para><command>-r</command>
Specify the number of rows (scanlines) in each strip of data
written to the output file.
By default,
<emphasis>tiffcp</emphasis>
attempts to set the rows/strip
that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a strip.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para><command>-s</command>
Force the output file to be written with data organized in strips
(rather than tiles).
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para><command>-t</command>
Force the output file to be written wtih data organized in tiles
(rather than strips).
options can be used to force the resultant image to be written
as strips or tiles of data, respectively.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para><command>-w</command>
Specify the width of a tile (in pixels).
<emphasis>tiffcp</emphasis>

<para><emphasis>tiffgt</emphasis>
displays one or more images stored using the
Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0.
Each image is placed in a fixed size window that the
user must position on the display (unless configured
otherwise through X defaults).
If the display has fewer than 24 bitplanes, or if the
image does not warrant full color, then
<emphasis>RGB</emphasis>
color values are mapped to the closest values that exist in
the colormap (this is done using the
<emphasis>rgbi</emphasis>
routine found in the graphics utility library
</para>

<para><emphasis>tiffgt</emphasis>
correctly handles files with any of the following characteristics:
BitsPerSample	1, 2, 4, 8, 16
SamplesPerPixel	1, 3, 4 (the 4th sample is ignored)
PhotometricInterpretation	0 (min-is-white), 1 (min-is-black), 2 (RGB), 3 (palette), 6 (YCbCr)
PlanarConfiguration	1 (contiguous), 2 (separate)
Orientation	1 (top-left), 4 (bottom-left)
Data may be organized as strips or tiles and may be
compressed with any of the compression algorithms supported
by the
<emphasis>libtiff (3)</emphasis>
library.
</para>

<para>For palette images (\c
<emphasis>PhotomatricInterpretation =3),</emphasis>
<emphasis>tiffgt</emphasis>
inspects the colormap values and assumes either 16-bit
or 8-bit values according to the maximum value.
That is, if no colormap entry greater than 255 is found,
<emphasis>tiffgt</emphasis>
assumes the colormap has only 8-bit values; otherwise
it assumes 16-bit values.
This inspection is done to handle old images written by
previous (incorrect) versions of
<emphasis>libtiff .</emphasis>
</para>

<para><emphasis>tiffgt</emphasis>
can be used to display multiple images one-at-a-time.
The left mouse button switches the display to the first image in the
<emphasis>next</emphasis>
file in the list of files specified on the command line.
The right mouse button switches to the first image in the
<emphasis>previous</emphasis>
file in the list.
The middle mouse button causes the first image in the first file
specified on the command line to be displayed.

<para>
<command>tiffinfo</command> is probably the most useful command which comes with libtiff... In normal operation, it shows you nicely formatted information about the TIFF image, like so:
</para>

<programlisting>
[mikal@localhost tutorial-imaging]$ tiffinfo tiff-figure9.tif 
TIFF Directory at offset 0x40f7c
  Image Width: 640 Image Length: 480
  Bits/Sample: 8
  Compression Scheme: Deflate
  Photometric Interpretation: min-is-black
  Samples/Pixel: 1
  Rows/Strip: 100000
  Planar Configuration: single image plane
[mikal@localhost tutorial-imaging]$ 
</programlisting>

<para>
When you ask nicely (with a -d), then you're shown random tiff data, which can be very handy:
</para>

</para>
</sect3>
<sect3><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para>Reads a TIFF file as input.
Produces a portable anymap as output.
The type of the output file depends on the input file - if it's
black &amp; white, generates a
<emphasis>pbm</emphasis>
file;
if it's grayscale, generates a
<emphasis>pgm</emphasis>
file; otherwise, a
<emphasis>ppm</emphasis>
file.  The program tells you which type it is writing.
</para>

<para>This program cannot read every possible TIFF file -- there are myriad
variations of the TIFF format.  However, it does understand monochrome
and gray scale, RGB, RGBA (red/green/blue with alpha channel), CMYK
(Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black ink color separation), and color palette
TIFF files.  An RGB file can have either single plane (interleaved)
color or multiple plane format.  The program reads 1-8 and 16
bit-per-sample input, the latter in either bigendian or littlendian
encoding.  Tiff directory information may also be either bigendian or
littendian.
</para>

<para>One reason this program isn't as general as TIFF programs often are is
that it does not use the TIFFRGBAImageGet() function of the TIFF
library to read TIFF files.  Rather, it uses the more primitive
TIFFReadScanLine() function and decodes it itself.
</para>

<para>There is no fundamental reason that this program could not read other
kinds of TIFF files; the existing limitations are mainly because no one
has asked for more.

The PNM output has the same maxval as the Tiff input, except that if
the Tiff input is colormapped (which implies a maxval of 65535) the
PNM output has a maxval of 255.  Though this may result in lost
information, such input images hardly ever actually have more color
resolution than a maxval of 255 provides and people often cannot deal
with PNM files that have maxval &gt; 255.  By contrast, a non-colormapped
Tiff image that doesn't need a maxval &gt; 255 doesn't
<emphasis>have</emphasis>
a maxval &gt; 255, so when we see a non-colormapped maxval &gt; 255, we take
it seriously and produce a matching output maxval.

The
<emphasis>tiff-filename</emphasis>
argument names the regular file that contains the Tiff image.  You
cannot use Standard Input or any other special file because the Tiff
library must be able to perform seeks on it.

<para></para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<para><command>tifftopnm </command>
creates a PGM (portable graymap) file containing the alpha channel
values in the input image.  If the input image doesn't contain an
alpha channel, the
<emphasis>alpha-filename</emphasis>
file contains all zero (transparent) alpha values.  If you don't specify
<command>tifftopnm</command>
does not generate an alpha file, and if the input image has an alpha channel,
<command>tifftopnm</command>
simply discards it.

If you specify
<command>-</command>
as the filename,
<command>tifftopnm</command>
writes the alpha output to Standard Output and discards the image.

See
for one way to use the alpha output file.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para><command>--headerdump</command>
Dump TIFF file information to stderr.  This information may be useful
in debugging TIFF file conversion problems.

Earlier in this chapter I promised that I would include the code for the repeated compression loss example, so here it is. The example is made up of a simple (and quite ugly) shell script, and a c program to actually compress the images...

<chapter id="chap-gif"><title>GIF</title>
<para>
<quote>
Between 1987 and 1994, GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) peacefully became the most popular file format for archiving and exchanging computer images. At the end of December 1994, CompuServe Inc. and Unisys Corporation announced to the public that developers would have to pay a license fee in order to continue to use technology patented by Unisys in certain categories of software supporting the GIF format. These first statements caused immediate reactions and some confusion. As a longer term consequence, it appears likely that GIF will be replaced and extended by new file formats, but not so before the expiration of the patent which caused so much debate.
</quote> -- http://www.cloanto.com/users/mcb/19950127giflzw.html (The GIF Controversy: A Software Developer's Perspective)
</para>

<para>
GIF was once the image format of choice for the Internet, in web browsers at least. This is not nearly as much the case today. The main reason for this is because Unisys has only relatively recently started enforcing the Patent they hold on LZW compression.
</para>

<para>
The disappearance of GIF from the scene is not a major loss, especially as the format was not particularly extensible.
</para>








<sect1><title>The GIF on disc format</title>
<para>
The GIF file format is much simpler than that used for TIFF files. Pay attention to this description though, because it will help explain PNG images when we get to them in a later chapter.
<para>

<sidebar><title>Data streams?</title>
<para>
It should be noted that the GIF specification doesn't speak of files as such. Instead it uses the term <quote>Data Stream</quote>, which is a concept which embraces files, as well as in memory buffers, and other interesting forms of data storage. It doesn't really make any difference to the discussion of the format here though.
</para>
</sidebar>

<sect2><title>The data stream</title>
<para>
The outer body of a GIF image is called a data stream, for reasons described in the last few paragraphs. This data stream can be thought of as a file for the purposes of this discussion. The data stream is composed of header, a section called the logical screen, the image data, and a trailer. These elements are described individually below.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>The header</title>

<para>
There are two main version numbers which are in common use for GIF images. These are:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>87a (released in May 1987)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>89a (released in July 1989)</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<sect3><title>Version numbers</title>
<para>
The GIF specification makes it quite clear that the image generator should use the lowest version number which matches the functionality required to correctly decode the image. This makes the generation of images a little more complex, as the generator needs to know the specification version number of each feature, but it ensures the maximum possible level of backwards compatability, without sacraficing accuracy of decoding of the image. To quote the GIF specification:
</para>

<para>
<quote>The version number in the Header of a Data Stream is intended to identify the minimum set of capabilities required of a decoder in order to fully process the Data Stream. An encoder should use the earliest possible version number that includes all the blocks used in the Data Stream. ... The encoder should make every attempt to use the earliest version number covering all the blocks in the Data Stream; the unnecessary use of later version numbers will hinder processing by some decoders.</quote>
</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Logical Screen</title>
<para>
The logical screen is the area on which the image will be painted. This block defines the characteristics of this virtual screen:

<para>
The determine the size of the of the global color table, simply apply this formula: <emphasis>size of global color table = 2 ^ (size in table + 1)</emphasis>. The maximum size of the global color table is therefore <emphasis>2 ^ (7 + 1)</empasis>, or 255 items.
</para>

<para>
There will actually be three times that number of color bytes in the global color table, because each color is 24 bit per pixel.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Global color table</title>
<para>
If the logical screen block of the image specified that a global color table is present in the image, then this is the next part of the GIF data stream. The global color table is a palette -- in other words, it maps the values actually stored in the image data to the 24 bit values which are the colors.
</para>

<para>
The format of the global color table is very simple, it is simply the red, green and blue values stored without any header or footer.

<para>
In this example, we do everything we need to open a PNG image, without actually reading the image data. The steps to getting to the image data are:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Open the file ready for reading. For this we just use the c standard library's <command>FILE *</command>, unlike the libtiff examples, in which we used a <command>TIFF *</command>
  <footnote><para>In reality, the libtiff could just use the <command>FILE *</command> method internally, although they don't always, as shown by the TIFFClientOpen examples in the TIFF chapter.</para></footnote>
. I'm not aware of whether we can fake out a <command>FILE *</command> if we wanted to pull a PNG out of something other than a file, one day when I have infinite free time I really should look more into this.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Another thing we need to do which libtiff does for us and libpng doesn't is check that the file really is a PNG file. We do this with the <command>png_check_sig</command>() call. This expects the first 8 bytes of the file to be handed to it, which is what the <command>fread</command>() function call gets for us.</para></listitem>

The <command>pnginfo</command> command implemented here is modeled on the <command>tiffinfo</command>, which was discussed in the TIFF chapter earlier in this tutorial. In fact, the output text is written to be as close to the <command>tiffinfo</command> command as possible.

THE ORIGINS OF THE Portable Document Format and the Adobe Acrobat product family date to early 1990. At that time, the PostScript page description language was rapidly becoming the worldwide standard for the production of the printed page. PDF builds on the PostScript page description language by layering a document structure and interactive navigation features on PostScript's underlying imaging model, providing a convenient, efficient mechanism enabling documents to be reliably viewed and printed anywhere. The PDF specification was first published at the same time the first Acrobat products were introduced in 1993.
</quote>
 -- PDF Specification
</para>

<para>
Portable Document Format (PDF) isn't strictly an image format. However, people are increasingly asking for PDF functionality in applications -- especially those on the Internet.
</para>

<para>
This chapter will focus on PDF 1.3 (second edition), because that is the specification version which I am most familiar with at the moment.
</para>

<sect1><title>Introduction</title>
<para>
<figure>
<title>Content</title>
<graphic format="EPS" fileref="todo.eps">
</figure>
</para>

<para>
This chapter is broken into five major sections. These are:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Discussion of the PDF format itself</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>An introduction to ClibPDF</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>An introduction to PDFLib</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>An introduction to Panda</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Discussion of the Adobe PDF tools</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>All about the PDF format</title>
<para>
The PDF file format is broken into a tree structure. This tree is made up of combinations of a few possible objects. We'll start by describing these objects, and then move onto how they fit together.
</para>

<sect2><title>File header</title>
<para>
Every PDF file starts with a simple header which declares the file to be a valid PDF file. This header will look something like this:
</para>

<programlisting>
%PDF-1.3 <9F><92><9C><9F>
</programlisting>

<para>
This header had the following parts:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis>%PDF-</emphasis>: this is a PDF document.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>1.3</emphasis>: it meets version 1.3 of the PDF specification.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis><9F><92><9C><9F></emphasis>: random binary stuff. This is just here so that <quote>smart</quote> FTP clients don't decide the file is an ASCII file in error
  <footnote><para>Whilst the vast majority of PDF structure is represented with ASCII text, this doesn't stop you from embedding binary into the file</para></footnote>
.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<sect3><title>Specification versions</title>
<para>
There have been five versions of the PDF specification released at the time of writing this document. They are:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis>1.0</emphasis>: maps functionality available in Adobe Acrobat 1.0</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>1.1</emphasis>: maps functionality available in Adobe Acrobat 2.0</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>1.2</emphasis>: maps functionality available in Adobe Acrobat 3.0</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>1.3 (both first and second editions)</emphasis>: maps functionality available in Adobe Acrobat 4.0</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>1.4</emphasis>: maps functionality available in Adobe Acrobat 5.0</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
In theory at least, the PDF specification versions should be backwards compatible -- viewers should ignore object types and dictionary entries that they don't understand. This means that you can also insert your own information into the PDF document without breaking its ability to be viewed in other applications.
</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Objects</title>
<para>
Objects in PDF files have a number, and a generation (version) number. They are represented as an ASCII text sequence in the file, for instance:
</para>

<programlisting>
1 0 obj
&lt;&lt;
        /Type /Catalog
        /Pages 2 0 R
&gt;&gt;
endobj
</programlisting>

<para>
This object is the 0th version of object number 1. The text between the &lt;&lt; and the &gt;&gt; is discussed in the next section.
</para>

<sidebar><title>Order of objects in the file</title>
<para>
Note that objects can appear in the file in any order, because there is a lookup table called an XREF table at the end of the file that they can be looked up from.
</para>
</sidebar>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Dictionaries</title>
<para>
Objects have associated with them a (key, value) pair database. This stores properties of the object -- these would normally include things like the dimensions of the page, or the name of the author of the document, and other interesting things like that.
</para>

<para>
In the example object above, we had the following dictionary items...
</para>

<programlisting>
        /Type /Catalog
        /Pages 2 0 R
</programlisting>

<para>
This dictionary specifies that the key <quote>Type</quote> has the value <quote>Catalog</quote>, and that the value <quote>Pages</quote> has the value <quote>2 0 R</quote>. This last value is an object reference, which we discuss in the Redirection section a little bit later in this chapter.
</para>

<sect3><title>Dictionary data types</title>
<para>
What data types are valid in dictionaries? Well, version 1.3 of the PDF specification names the following data types:
</para>

<figure>
<title>Do these</title>
<graphic format="EPS" fileref="todo.eps">
</figure>
<sect4><title>Boolean</title>
<para>
Boolean values are represented with the words <command>true</command> and <command>false</command>.
</para>

<sect5><title>Examples</title>
<programlisting>
/ExplodeOnOpening true
/Rotate false
</programlisting>
</sect5>
</sect4>

<sect4><title>A lexer for PDF</title>
<para>
Refer to the lexer for PDF documents at the end of this chapter if you are more interested in the format of data types.
</para>
</sect4>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Minimal dictionaries</title>
<para>
In addition to having full dictionaries, it is possible to have very simple objects which only have one value in the dictionary, these objects look a little different than a normal object, for instance:
</para>

<programlisting>
17 0 obj
203
endobj
</programlisting>

<para>
In this example, the object stores a simple integer value. Why would you want to do this? Well, the answer is that in a dictionary you can have the value for the key stored in another object:
</para>

<programlisting>
42 0 obj
&lt;&lt;
  /Length 24 0 R
&gt;&gt;
endobj

24 0 obj
462
endobj
</programlisting>

<para>
Here, we don't know the length of the stream associated with the object (I describe these in a second) at the time we wrote the object out, so we can simply insert it later in the document. This is called an object reference, which is in the form:
</para>

<programlisting>
objectnumber revision R
</programlisting>
</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Streams</title>
<para>
The other type of data that an object can have associated with it is a stream. Streams are used to store less structured data, for instance descriptions of the items on a page, or random binary data. The form for a stream is:
</para>

<programlisting>
42 0 obj
&lt;&lt;
  /Length 24 0 R
&gt;&gt;
stream
...stream data...
endstream
endobj
</programlisting>

<para>
A description for the page layout descriptions is outside the scope of this document. 


The other type of information which can be stored in a stream is arbitary information such as the content of images (which would normally be raster information). 


An indepth discussion of the formatting of the raster information is also outside the scope of this document.
</para>

<sect3><title>Filters on streams</title>
<para>
Streams can be filtered. A filter is an operation which occurs on the stream contents before they are saved into the PDF document, examples include compression, and ASCII85 encoding
  <footnote><para>ASCII85 encoding is when you take binary data (which will be in the range 0x00 to 0xFF per byte, and force it into the range 0x00 to 0x55. This is done because some transport mediums (such as email), cannot handle binary data, so the data is made to look more like ASCII information. Note that this bloats the size of the data somewhat.</para></footnote>
, which can't really be called compression.
</para>

<para>
So what are the possible filters? Well, as of PDF 1.3
  <footnote><para>More have been added to this list in PDF 1.4</para></footnote>
, they are:

<sect1><title>Support for presentations</title>
<para>
PDF documents can be used to create presentation slide shows. There are two main features which support this use of PDF -- page duration, and page transitions. The page duration is the amount of time that the page will appear on the screen before the PDF viewer automatically moves onto the next page. The transition is the effect applied to the PDF pages when they are being swapped between -- this is very similar to the Microsoft PowerPoint presentations.
</para>

<para>
It is important to note that not all PDF viewers support this functionality.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>On with the libraries</title>
<para>
Now that we've discussed the format of the PDF file format, we can talk about the different options for building PDF files. The three main options are ClibPDF, PDFlib, and Panda. Adobe also sells a PDf library, but it has a reputation for being extremely expensive.
</para>

<para>
In our discussion of the three libraries, we will work through the same set of programs, to give you an opportunity to compare the three libraries. After all, they all have their own strengths, and weaknesses.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>ClibPDF</title>
<para>
ClibPDF was my first introduction to PDF generation APIs. It is available from http://www.fastio.com, and was last updated in December 1999, so it is starting to get a little old. There are still many people who use ClibPDF however.
</para>

<para>
To summarise the license, this quote from the ClibPDF README page sums it up:
</para>

<programlisting>
This package is released under:
FastIO ClibPDF Software License 1.30, January 27, 2000.

ClibPDF and Premium ClibPDF are not public-domain or free software.
</programlisting>

<para>
This almost certainly limits what you can do with the library, and means that using the library will cost you money.
</para>

<sect2><title>Installation</title>
<para>
The first step to installing ClibPDF is to download the source from http://www.fastio.com. At the time of writing the source download is on the front page, about half way down. I can't guarantee that this wont have changed by the time you come to download the library, but then again the page hasn't changed in several years now, so it doesn't strike me a likely.
</para>

<sect3><title>Unix</title>
<para>
ClibPDF does not use configure scripts. The first step of the installation is to therefore copy your operating system's Makefile over the top of the sample Makefile. The various distributed Makefiles are:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Makefile.AIX42</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Makefile.BSDI</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Makefile.Cygwin</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Makefile.FreeBSD</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Makefile.HPUX</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Makefile.irix62gcc</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Makefile.MacOSX</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Makefile.NetBSD</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Makefile.NEXTSTEP</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Makefile.SolarisGCC</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Makefile.SolarisSunCC</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Makefile.SunOS5x</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
If your operating system isn't listed in the available Makefiles, you'll need to copy the closest one and then edit it until the compile works.
</para>

<para>
Once you have copied your Makefile to the file named <emphasis>Makefile</emphasis>, then follow these steps to install ClibPDF...
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>make</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>make lib</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>make install</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
You might need to edit parts of the Makefile to make the install work properly for your system.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>win32</title>
<para>
ClibPDF doesn't support win32 directly. It is however written in ANSI C, so a port shouldn't be very hard at all.

</sect2>

<sect2><title>Hello world example</title>
<para>
The most basic PDF example is the hello world application. Here is the ClibPDF iteration:
</para>

<programlisting>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;cpdflib.h&gt;

int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  CPDFdoc *pdf;

  // Open the document
  pdf = cpdf_open (0, NULL);
  cpdf_init (pdf);
  
  // Create a page
  cpdf_pageInit (pdf, 1, PORTRAIT, LETTER, LETTER);

  // Put some text on that page
  cpdf_beginText (pdf, 0);
  cpdf_setFont (pdf, "Times-Italic", "WinAnsiEncoding", 48.0);
  cpdf_text (pdf, 1.0, 8.0, 0.0, "Hello World");
  cpdf_endText (pdf);

  // Write the PDF out to disc
  cpdf_finalizeAll (pdf);
  cpdf_savePDFmemoryStreamToFile (pdf, "hello.pdf");
  cpdf_close (pdf);
  return 0;
}
</programlisting>
<para><emphasis>Code: source/pdf/clibpdf/hello/hello.c</emphasis></para>

<para>
This produces a PDF which looks like (somewhat reduced from it's real size)...
</para>

<figure>
<title>ClibPDF hello world</title>
<graphic format="EPS" fileref="source/pdf/clibpdf/hello/hello.pdf.eps">
</figure>


<para>
The first block initializes ClibPDF, then we create a page, put some text on it, and then close the document.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Initialization</title>
<programlisting>
CPDFdoc *cpdf_open(int pspdf, CPDFdocLimits *docLimits);
void cpdf_init(CPDFdoc *pdf);

char  *cpdf_getOutputFilename(CPDFdoc *pdf);
void cpdf_setOutputFilename(CPDFdoc *pdf, const char *file);
</programlisting>

<para>
ClibPDF requires multiple initialization calls. As seen in the hello world example above, we needed to call <command>cpdf_open</command> and <command>cpdf_init</command> at the start of our application. <command>cpdf_open</command> initializes ClibPDF itself, and returns a pointer to a <command>CPDFdoc</command>, which will represent our document. This pointer must then be initialized with a call to <command>cpdf_init</command>. The <command>*OutputFilename</command> functions are used to get and set the filename that the PDF document will be written to when finalized.
</para>

<sect2><title>Creating pages</title>
<programlisting>
int cpdf_pageInit(CPDFdoc *pdf, int pagenum, int rot, const char *mediaboxstr, const char *cropboxstr);
int cpdf_setCurrentPage(CPDFdoc *pdf, int page);
</programlisting>

<para>
Creating pages in ClibPDF is done with the <command>cpdf_pageInit</command> function. This function takes some arguements:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis>CPDFdoc *pdf</emphasis>: the PDF document to add the page to</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>int pagenum</emphasis>: the page number for the new page (the first page of a PDF is page 1)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>int rot</emphasis>: whether the page is PORTRAIT or LANDSCAPE (defined in the cpdflib header)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>const char *mediaboxstr</emphasis>: the page size string, see below</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>const char *cropboxstr</emphasis>: the crop box for the page</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<figure>
<title>Define crop box in the PDF intro</title>
<graphic format="EPS" fileref="todo.eps">
</figure>

<para>
There are some default page size strings provided by ClibPDF, although it is possible to use your own as well. The sizes provided by ClibPDF are:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>LETTER</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>LEGAL</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>A4</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>B5</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>C5</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
There are also the following other page sizes, which for some reason aren't documented in the manual...
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>DL</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>EXECUTIVE</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>COMM10</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>MONARCH</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>FILM35MM</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Page size strings are as embedded into the PDF document (which matches how Panda uses these strings as well). The format of the string is left, top, right, bottom. For example:
</para>

<programlisting>
0 0 612 792
</programlisting>

<para>
You can also be working on multiple pages at once. Use the <command>cpdf_setCurrentPage</command> function to switch between pages (compare this with how PDFlib and Panda implement this).
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Finalization</title>
<programlisting>
void cpdf_finalizePage(CPDFdoc *pdf, int page);
void cpdf_finalizeAll(CPDFdoc *pdf);
int cpdf_savePDFmemoryStreamToFile(CPDFdoc *pdf, const char *file);
char *cpdf_getBufferForPDF(CPDFdoc *pdf, int *length);
</programlisting>

<para>
These functions are used to finalize the PDF document. Use the <command>cpdf_finalizePage</command> function to force a page to be generated immediately. This may decrease resource usage for the PDF document. This function call is optional. <command>cpdf_finalizeAll</command> is called to write the PDF document out to the memory stream or the file on disc. If this function is not called, then the PDF file will be empty. You cannot add items to the PDF file once it has been finalized. <command>cpdf_close</command> closes the PDF file and deallocates resources which were consumed by the file.

<programlisting>
void cpdf_enableCompression(CPDFdoc *pdf, int cmpON);
</programlisting>

<para>
This function will enable compression of page descriptions, which can quite significantly reduce the size of the PDF document. This function simply enables a Flate filter on these page description streams.
</para>

<programlisting>
void cpdf_setDefaultDomainUnit(CPDFdoc *pdf, float defunit);
... and a variety of other domain function calls ...
</programlisting>

<para>
Explain domains
</para>

<programlisting>
void cpdf_useContentMemStream(CPDFdoc *pdf, int flag);
</programlisting>

<para>
This function call can be called if you want to use temporary files instead of memory buffers. This can be useful for machines which don't have much memory, but it is quite slow. You might find that you are better off simply increasing the amount of swap space allocated on the system. The ClibPDF documentation also implies that this function call is not thread safe.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Room for improvement</title>
<programlisting>
void cpdf_setGlobalDocumentLimits(int maxPages, int maxFonts, int maxImages, int maxAnnots, int maxObjects);
</programlisting>

<para>
ClibPDF has internal limitations for the sizes of various data structures. These must be explicitly changed before the library is used if they don't fit your needs. The defaults are:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Maximum number of pages</emphasis>: default value is 100</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Maximum number of fonts</emphasis>: default value is 180</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Maximum number of images (rasters)</emphasis>: default value is 100</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Maximum number of annotations</emphasis>: default value is 100</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Maximum number of objects</emphasis>: default value is 5,000 (it is strange that this value is exposed to the user)</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
These values can be changed using the <command>CPDFdocLimits</command> structure, which is passed to many of the ClibPDF function calls. It is interesting to note that this gives us a perspective on the internal coding style of ClibPDF. Many of the internal structures are based on fixed size arrays, which is why the size must be known from the start. These arrays will allow for ClibPDF to be marginally faster than implementations that use linked lists, but it also decreases the utility of the library.

<sect1><title>Panda</title>
<para>
Panda is my own PDF generation library. I wrote it because I was not happy with the license and some of the limitations with ClibPDF, and the license for PDFlib wasn't acceptable. To be honest, the best way to learn about something is also to build an implementation of it, which was an additional motivation.
</para>

<para>
You can get Panda from http://www.stillhq.com, and is licensed under the GNU GPL, which can be found at the start of this tutorial.
</para>

<sect2><title>Installation</title>
<para>
First, download Panda from http://www.stillhq.com, and then follow these simple steps:
</para>

<sect3><title>Unix</title>
<para>
Follow these simple steps to install Panda on your unix system:
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>./configure</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>make</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>
This will also build the examples in the examples directory.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>win32</title>
<para>
Panda currently compiles quite happily on Windows, and if you download the right version of the tarball even includes a Microsoft Visual Studio project file. Note that the current version of Panda (0.5.1), doesn't include a COM wrapper for Panda, so you either need to be programing in C or C++, or a language which can import DLL symbols (for instance Microsoft Visual Basic).
</para>

<sect2><title>Hello world example</title>

The most basic PDF example is the hello world application. Here is the Panda iteration:

#include  &lt;panda/functions.h&gt;
#include  &lt;panda/constants.h&gt;

int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  panda_pdf *demo;
  panda_page *currPage;

  // Initialise the library
  panda_init ();

  // Open our demo PDF
  if ((demo = panda_open ("hello.pdf", "w")) == NULL)
    {
      fprintf (stderr, "Could not open hello.pdf\n");
      exit (1);
    }

  // Create a page
  currPage = panda_newpage (demo, panda_pagesize_a4);

  // Write some text to the page
  panda_setfont (demo, panda_createfont (demo, "Times-Roman", 1,
  					 "MacRomanEncoding"));
  panda_textbox (demo, currPage, 600, 10, 700, 300, "Hello world");

  // Finished all the demoing, close the PDF document
  panda_close (demo);
  return 0;
}
</programlisting>
<para><emphasis>Code: source/pdf/panda/hello/hello.c</emphasis></para>

<sect1><title>A lexer for PDF</title>
<para>
Part of my Panda work has been the development of a lexer for PDF documents known as Panda<emphasis>Lex</emphasis>. Whilst Panda<emphasis>Lex</emphasis> is by no means complete, it might prove to be useful for your understanding of the PDF document structure. I have therefore included it here. The lexer takes the form of several components: a lexer for the grammar, a grammar, and some c code to hold it all together.
