I had problems with: </para></sect3><sidebar>... The answer was:

<xmldoc> mikal: wrap the sidebar in a sect3. the basic rule with docbook sections is that you can have paragraphs and other block-level stuff before them, but not after them. So basically, the only thing that can follow that sect3 in your doc is another sect3.
