Between 1987 and 1994, GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) peacefully became the most popular file format for archiving and exchanging computer images. At the end of December 1994, CompuServe Inc. and Unisys Corporation announced to the public that developers would have to pay a license fee in order to continue to use technology patented by Unisys in certain categories of software supporting the GIF format. These first statements caused immediate reactions and some confusion. As a longer term consequence, it appears likely that GIF will be replaced and extended by new file formats, but not so before the expiration of the patent which caused so much debate.

<slidebreak>
<slideinclude>
<para>
GIF was once the image format of choice for the Internet, in web browsers at least. This is not nearly as much the case today. The main reason for this is because Unisys has only relatively recently started enforcing the Patent they hold on LZW compression.
</para>

<para>
The disappearance of GIF from the scene is not a major loss, especially as the format was not particularly extensible.

<sect1><title>The GIF on disc format</title>
<para>
The GIF file format is much simpler than that used for TIFF files. Pay attention to this description though, because it will help explain PNG images when we get to them in a later chapter.
</para>

<slidetext>
<li>The GIF format is quite simple -- the entire specification is only a few pages
<li>We only describe the format
<li>Mainly because it will help with the explaination of PNG

<noslide>
<sidebar><title>Data streams?</title>
<para>
It should be noted that the GIF specification doesn't speak of files as such. Instead it uses the term <quote>Data Stream</quote>, which is a concept which embraces files, as well as in memory buffers, and other interesting forms of data storage. It doesn't really make any difference to the discussion of the format here though.
</para>
</sidebar>
</noslide>

<sect2><title>The data stream</title>
<para>
The outer body of a GIF image is called a data stream, for reasons described in the last few paragraphs. This data stream can be thought of as a file for the purposes of this discussion. The data stream is composed of header, a section called the logical screen, the image data, and a trailer. These elements are described individually below.
</para>

<slidetext>
<li>We're going to refer to the term data stream a bit in the coming slides...
<li>The GIF specification doesn't refer to files
<li>The equivalent concept is a data stream
<li>A data stream doesn't have to be a file

<sect3><title>Version numbers</title>
<para>
The GIF specification makes it quite clear that the image generator should use the lowest version number which matches the functionality required to correctly decode the image. This makes the generation of images a little more complex, as the generator needs to know the specification version number of each feature, but it ensures the maximum possible level of backwards compatability, without sacraficing accuracy of decoding of the image. To quote the GIF specification:
</para>

<slidetext>
<li>The GIF specification states that the image generator should use the lowest version number possible
<li>Whilst still having the image make sense
<li>This makes the generation of images a little more complex
<li>It ensures the maximum backwards compatability

<sect3><title>Formula for global color table size</title>
<para>
To determine the size of the of the global color table, simply apply this formula: <emphasis>size of global color table = 2 ^ (size in table + 1)</emphasis>. The maximum size of the global color table is therefore <emphasis>2 ^ (7 + 1)</emphasis>, or 255 items.
</para>

<slidetext>
<pre>
size of global color table = 2 ^ (size in table + 1)
</pre>

<li>The maximum size is therefore:

<pre>
2 ^ (7 + 1)
</pre>

<li>Which is 255 items
<li>There will actually be three times that number of color bytes in the global color table
<li>... Because colors are 24 bit per pixel

If the logical screen block of the image specified that a global color table is present in the image, then this is the next part of the GIF data stream. The global color table is a palette -- in other words, it maps the values actually stored in the image data to the 24 bit values which are the colors.

The raster information for the image is stored in a series of image data blocks, each block having a maximum size of 255 bytes, which works well on machines with very little memory.

Each of these image data blocks is LZW compressed as part of one big buffer. The format of the image data blocks is:
