This is giflib version 4.1.0, a library for manipulating gif files.  It is based
on Eric S. Raymond's giflib-3.0 with bugfixes and changes generated for the
libungif library.

PLEASE BE AWARE OF POSSIBLE LEGAL PROBLEMS WITH USING THIS LIBRARY: READ
THE PATENT_PROBLEMS FILE NOW!

Latest versions of giflib, as well as a library which does not have the
mentioned patent problems (libungif), are available from:

    ftp://prtr-13.ucsc.edu/pub/libungif/

You can see a web page with late breaking announcements at:

====
Building this package should be as simple as:

    ./configure
    gmake
    gmake install

====
I have found that automake currently generates Makefile's containing some
GNUmake specific syntax.  If you cannot use GNU make for some reason and find
that the generated makefile's won't work on your system, you will
have to copy the Makefile.unx file to Makefile and configure the old way by
following the directions in INSTALL.old.  There are three Makefile.unx files
for the three directories that compilation occurs in:
    the top dir (where the file you are reading is located)
    lib
    util

I am not maintaining these Makefiles so they may be broken at present.  If you
want to contribute fixes to them, I'll include them in the next distribution.
(But it may be easier just to install gmake on your system.)

====
This package uses autoconf, automake, and libtool to create the configure
script, so if you need to edit the configure.in or change a makefile target
you should read the DEVELOPER file for hints on recreating the distribution
using these tools.

Good luck!
