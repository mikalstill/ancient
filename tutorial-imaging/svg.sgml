SVG
  <footnote><para>Short for Scalar Vector Graphics.</para></footnote>
is a recent newcomer on the image format scene. The standard is under development by the w3c, and can be found at http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG. SVG is an interesting change from the other image formats in this tutorial for a couple of reasons, not least being that it is not a raster format like the vast majority of the others discussed in these pages. The other interesting thing about SVG is that the images are not stored in a binary form, they are stored as XML documents, which makes them very easy to edit.
