<title>About the author</title>
<para>
Michael has been working in the image processing field for several years, including a couple of years managing and developing large image databases for an Australian government department. He currently works for TOWER Software, who manufacture a world leading EDMS and Records Management package named TRIM. Michael is also the developer of Panda, an open source PDF generation API, as well as being the maintainer of the comp.text.pdf USENET frequently asked questions document. You can contact Michael at mikal@stillhq.com.

<para>
There are some things which I assume you know, and which are outside the scope of this tutorial.
</para>

<sect2><title>C</title>
<para>
This tutorial discusses code. Almost all of the code discussed is written in C. It is therefore safe to assume that if you don't have a good working knowledge of C, then you're likely to get a lot less out of this tutorial as those who do know some C. On the other hand, don't worry about the more esoteric syntax, I'll explain this as we need it.

There are many people who need to be thanked when one attempts a project of this size. I would specifically like to thank my wife and son, who put up with me being geeky so very often.

<sect1><title>License</title>
<para>
This document is covered by two licenses -- the license for the text of this document, and the license for the included source code. The license terms are set out below.
</para>

<sect2><title>License for text (OPL)</title>
<para>
OPEN PUBLICATION LICENSE  Draft v0.4, 8 June 1999
</para>

<para>
I. REQUIREMENTS ON BOTH UNMODIFIED AND MODIFIED VERSIONS
</para>

<para>
The Open Publication works may be reproduced and distributed in whole or
in part, in any medium physical or electronic, provided that the terms
of this license are adhered to, and that this license or an
incorporation of it by reference (with any options elected by the
author(s) and/or publisher) is displayed in the reproduction.
</para>

<para>
Proper form for an incorporation by reference is as follows:
</para>

<para>
Copyright (c) &lt;year&gt; by &lt;author's name or designee&gt;.  This material may
be distributed only subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the
Open Publication License, vX.Y or later (the latest version is presently
available at &lt;URL:http:// TBD&gt;).
</para>

<para>
The reference must be immediately followed with any options elected by
the author(s) and/or publisher of the document (see section VI).
</para>

<para>
Commercial redistribution of Open Publication-licensed material is
permitted.
</para>

<para>
Any publication in standard (paper) book form shall require the citation
of the original publisher and author. The publisher and author's names
shall appear on all outer surfaces of the book.  On all outer surfaces
of the book the original publisher's name shall be as large as the title
of the work and cited as possessive with respect to the title.
</para>

<para>

II. COPYRIGHT
</para>

<para>
The copyright to each Open Publication is owned by its author(s) or
designee.
</para>

<para>
III. SCOPE OF LICENSE
</para>

<para>
The following license terms apply to all Open Publication works, unless
otherwise explicitly stated in the document.
</para>

<para>
Mere aggregation of Open Publication works or a portion of an Open
Publication work with other works or programs on the same media shall
not cause this license to apply to those other works. The aggregate work
shall contain a notice specifying the inclusion of the Open Publication
material and appropriate copyright notice.
</para>

<para>
SEVERABILITY. If any part of this license is found to be unenforceable
in any jurisdiction, the remaining portions of the license remain in
force.
</para>

<para>
NO WARRANTY. Open Publication works are licensed and provided "as is"
without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
particular purpose or a warranty of non-infringement.
</para>

<para>
IV. REQUIREMENTS ON MODIFIED WORKS
</para>

<para>
All modified versions of documents covered by this license, including
translations, anthologies, compilations and partial documents, must meet
the following requirements:
</para>

<para>
1) The modified version must be labeled as such.
</para>

<para>
2) The person making the modifications must be identified and the
   modifications dated.
</para>

<para>
3) Acknowledgement of the original author and publisher if applicable
   must be retained according to normal academic citation practices.
</para>

<para>
4) The location of the original unmodified document must be identified.
</para>

<para>
5) The original author's (or authors') name(s) may not be used to assert
   or imply endorsement of the resulting document without the original
   author's (or authors') permission.
</para>

<para>

V. GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS
</para>

<para>
In addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from
and strongly recommended of redistributors that:
</para>

<para>
1) If you are distributing Open Publication works on hardcopy or CD-ROM,
   you provide email notification to the authors of your intent to
   redistribute at least thirty days before your manuscript or media
   freeze, to give the authors time to provide updated documents. This
   notification should describe modifications, if any, made to the
   document.
</para>

<para>
2) All substantive modifications (including deletions) be either clearly
   marked up in the document or else described in an attachment to the
   document. 
</para>

<para>
Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is considered
good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and CD-ROM expression of
an Open Publication-licensed work to its author(s).
</para>

<para>
VI. LICENSE OPTIONS
</para>

<para>
The author(s) and/or publisher of an Open Publication-licensed document
may elect certain options by appending language to the reference to or
copy of the license. These options are considered part of the license
instance and must be included with the license (or its incorporation by
reference) in derived works.
</para>

<para>
A. To prohibit distribution of substantively modified versions without
   the explicit permission of the author(s). "Substantive modification"
   is defined as a change to the semantic content of the document, and
   excludes mere changes in format or typographical corrections. 
</para>

<para>
   To accomplish this, add the phrase `Distribution of substantively
   modified versions of this document is prohibited without the explicit
   permission of the copyright holder.' to the license reference or
   copy. 
</para>

<para>
B. To prohibit any publication of this work or derivative works in whole
   or in part in standard (paper) book form for commercial purposes is
   prohibited unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright
   holder.
</para>

<para>
   To accomplish this, add the phrase `Distribution of the work or
   derivative of the work in any standard (paper) book form is
   prohibited unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright
   holder.' to the license reference or copy. 
</para>

<para>
OPEN PUBLICATION POLICY APPENDIX:
</para>

<para>
(This is not considered part of the license.)
</para>

<para>
Open Publication works are available in source format via the Open
Publication home page at &lt;URL:tbd&gt;.
</para>

<para>
Open Publication authors who want to include their own license on Open
Publication works may do so, as long as their terms are not more
restrictive than the Open Publication license.
</para>

<para>
If you have questions about the Open Publication License, please contact
TBD, and/or the Open Publication Authors' List at &lt;TBD&gt;, via email.

<sect2><title>License for source code (GPL)</title>
<para>
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991
</para>

<para>
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</para>

<para>

			    Preamble
</para>

<para>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
</para>

<para>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
</para>

<para>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
</para>

<para>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
</para>

<para>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
</para>

<para>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
</para>

<para>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
</para>

<para>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
</para>

<para>
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
</para>

<para>
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
</para>

<para>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
</para>

<para>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
</para>

<para>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
</para>

<para>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
</para>

<para>
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
</para>

<para>
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.
</para>

<para>
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
</para>

<para>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
</para>

<para>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
</para>

<para>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
</para>

<para>
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
</para>

<para>
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
</para>

<para>
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,
</para>

<para>
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</para>

<para>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
</para>

<para>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
</para>

<para>
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
</para>

<para>
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
</para>

<para>
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
</para>

<para>
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
</para>

<para>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
</para>

<para>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
</para>

<para>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
</para>

<para>
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
</para>

<para>
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
</para>

<para>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
</para>

<para>
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
</para>

<para>
			    NO WARRANTY
</para>

<para>
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
</para>

<para>
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</para>

<para>
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
</para>

<para>
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
</para>

<para>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
</para>

<para>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
</para>

<para>
    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) 19yy  &lt;name of author&gt;
</para>

<para>
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.
</para>

<para>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.
</para>

<para>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
</para>

<para>

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
</para>

<para>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:
</para>

<para>
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
</para>

<para>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
</para>

<para>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
</para>

<para>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
</para>

<para>
  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice
</para>

<para>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

<chapter id="chap-concepts"><title>Imaging concepts</title>
<para>
There are some core terms which are used throughout this tutorial. This section defines these terms -- it's probably therefore worth bookmarking this section for reference throughout the rest of the day.
</para>

<sect1><title>Rasters</title>
<para>
     <indexterm><primary>Raster</primary></indexterm>
     <indexterm><primary>Image format</primary><secondary>raster</secondary></indexterm>
The most common image format (and the focus of the majority of this tutorial) is raster image formats. Raster image formats are those which store the picture as a bitmap
     <footnote><para>You can think of a bitmap as being simply an array of pixels. We'll talk more about this later</para></footnote>
describing the state of pixels, as opposed to recording the length and locations of primatives such as lines and curves. Common examples include the output of photoshop, the gimp, scanners and digital cameras. Effectively, your monitor and printer are raster output devices.
</para>

<figure>
<title>A sample raster image</title>
<graphic format="EPS" fileref="raster-figure1.eps"></graphic>
</figure>

<para>
Raster image formats include TIFF, GIF, PNG, and most of the other formats in this tutorial. If in doubt, assume that it's a raster format unless I tell you otherwise.
</para>

<para>
If we zoom in enough on a portion of this image, we can see that it is made up of descrete elements -- the pixels. TODO zoom image
</para>

<title>Zooming in on a portion of the raster image</title>
<graphic format="EPS" fileref="raster-figure2.eps"></graphic>
</figure>

<para>
The code to produce this zoomed image is presented in the TIFF chapter of this tutorial. TODO make it so.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>Vector</title>
<para>
     <indexterm><primary>Vector</primary></indexterm>
     <indexterm><primary>Image format</primary><secondary>vector</secondary></indexterm>
Some images aren't raster images. These images are normally composed of primative drawing commands, such as draw a line, draw a circle, et cetera. The advantage of vector formats is that it is an exact representation of the image, they also scale much better. Examples of vector formats include Scalar Vector Graphics (SVG), Adobe Illustrator files, Windows Meta Files, and to a certain extent PDF documents. A plotter is a vector output device.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>Pixel</title>
<para>
     <indexterm><primary>Pixel</primary></indexterm>
A pixel is the lowest unit of raster image description -- in other words, a raster image is defined in terms of pixels.

TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a raster image format which was originally produced by Adobe. TIFF is an extremely common, but quite complex raster image format. Libtiff is a standard implementation of the TIFF specification, which is free and works on many operating systems. This chapter discusses some of the pitfalls of TIFF, and guides the reader through use of the libtiff library. This chapter provides examples on how to use libtiff for your black and white imaging needs.

<title>Coding for TIFF can be hard</title>
<para>	
Most file format specifications define some basic rules for the representation of the file. For instance, PNG (a compeditor to TIFF) documents are always big endian. TIFF doesn't mandate things like this though, here is a list of some of the seemingly basic things that it doesn't define:

<orderedlist>
  <listitem><para>The byte order -- big endian, or little endian</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>The fill order of the bit within the image bytes -- most significant bit first, or least significant</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>The meaning of a given pixel value for black and white -- is 0 black, or white?</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>...and so on</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<para>
This means that creating a TIFF can be very easy, because it is rare to have to do any conversion of the data that you already have. It does mean, on the other hand, that being able to read in random tiffs created by other applications can be very hard -- you have to code for all these possible combinations in order to be reasonably certain of having a reliable product.
</para>
	
<para>
So how do you write an application which can read in all these different possible permutations of the TIFF format? The most important thing to remember is to <emphasis>never make assumptions about the format of the image data you are reading in</emphasis>.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Writing TIFF files</title>
<para>
The first thing I want to do is show you how to write a TIFF file out. We'll then get onto how to read a TIFF file back into your program.
</para>
	
<sect2>
<title>Infrastructure for writing</title>
<para>
It is traditional for bitmaps to be represented inside your code with an array of chars. This is because on most operating systems, a char maps well to one byte. In the block of code below, we will setup libtiff, and create a simple buffer which contains an image which we can then write out to disc.
</para>

<programlisting>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;

int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char buffer[32 * 9];
}
</programlisting>

<para>
The code above is pretty simple. All you need to use libtiff is to include the tiffio.h header file. To compile this, use the command <command>gcc foo.c -o foo -ltiff -lm</command>. The <command>-ltiff</command> is a command which will include the library named libtiff, which needs to be in your library path. Once you have started specifing libraries explicitly, you also need to add <command>-lm</command>, which is the mathematics library. The char buffer that we have defined here is going to be our black and white image, so we should define one of those next...
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Writing the image</title>
<para>
To make up for how boring that example was, I am now pleased to present you with possibly the worst picture of the Sydney Harbour Bridge ever drawn. In the example below, the image is already in the image buffer, and all we have to do is save it to the file on disc. The example first opens a tiff image in write mode, and then places the image into that file.
</para>

<para>
Please note, that for clarity I have omitted the actual hex for the image, this is available in the download version of this code for those who are interested.
</para>

<programlisting>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
  // Define an image
  char buffer[25 * 144] = { /* boring hex omitted */ };
  TIFF *image;

  // Open the TIFF file
  if((image = TIFFOpen("output.tif", "w")) == NULL){
    printf("Could not open output.tif for writing\n");
    exit(42);
  }

  // We need to set some values for basic tags before we can add any data
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_IMAGEWIDTH, 25 * 8);
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_IMAGELENGTH, 144);
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_BITSPERSAMPLE, 1);
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_SAMPLESPERPIXEL, 1);
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_ROWSPERSTRIP, 144);

  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_COMPRESSION, COMPRESSION_CCITTFAX4);
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_PHOTOMETRIC, PHOTOMETRIC_MINISWHITE);
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_FILLORDER, FILLORDER_MSB2LSB);
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_PLANARCONFIG, PLANARCONFIG_CONTIG);

  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_XRESOLUTION, 150.0);
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_YRESOLUTION, 150.0);
  TIFFSetField(image, TIFFTAG_RESOLUTIONUNIT, RESUNIT_INCH);
  
  // Write the information to the file
  TIFFWriteEncodedStrip(image, 0, buffer, 25 * 144);

  // Close the file
  TIFFClose(image);
}
</programlisting>

<para>
There are some interesting things to note in this example. The most interesting of these is that the output image will not display using the xview command on my linux machine. In fact, I couldn't find an example of a group 4 fax compressed black and white image which would display using that program. See the sidebar for more detail.
</para>

<sidebar>
<title>Problems with xview</title>
<para>
Xview is part of the xloadimage package written by Jim Frost, which comes with X windows.
</para>

<para>
It's a good example of how hard it can be to handle TIFF images well. I am currently working on a patch to submit to Jim which will resolve this problem. If you have trouble viewing the output of the sample code, then try using some other program, like the gimp.
</para>
</sidebar>

<para>
The sample code shows the basics of using the libtiff API. The following interesting points should be noted...
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>The buffers presented to and returned from libtiff each contain 8 pixels in a single byte. This means that you have to be able to extract the pixels you are interested in. The use of masks, and the right and left shift operators come in handy here.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The TIFFOpen function is very similar to the fopen function we are all familiar with.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>We need to set the value for quite a few fields before we can start writing the image out. These fields give libtiff information about the size and shape of the image, as well as the way that data will be compresed within the image. These fields need to be set before you can start handing image data to libtiff. There are many more fields for which a value could be set, I have used close to the bar minimum in this example.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>TIFFWriteEncodedStrip is the function call which actually inserts the image into the file. This call inserts uncompressed image data into the file. This means that libtiff will compress the image data for you before writing it to the file. If you have already compressed data, then have a look at the TIFFWriteRawStrip instead.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Finally, we close the file with TIFFClose.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<sidebar>
<title>More information about the libtiff function calls</title>
<para>
If you need more information about any of the libtiff function calls mentioned in this chapter, then checkout the extensive man pages which come with the library. Remember that case is important with man pages, so you need to get the case in the function names right -- it's TIFFOpen, not tiffopen.

<title>Reading TIFF files</title>
<para>
Reading TIFF files reliably is much harder than writing them. Unfortunately, I don't have enough space in this chapter to discuss all of the important issues. Some of them will need to be left to later chapters. There are also plenty of pages on the web which discuss the issues involved. Some of my favourites are included in the references section at the end of this chapter.
</para>

<para>
The issue that complicates reading black and white TIFF images the most is the several different storage schemes which are possible within the TIFF file itself. libtiff doesn't hold your hand much with these schemes, so you have to be able to handle them yourself. The three schemes TIFF supports are single stripped images, stripped images, and tiled images.
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>A single strip image is as the name suggests -- a special case of a stripped image. In this case, all of the bitmap is stored in one large block. I have experienced reliability issues with images which are single strip on Windows machines. The general recommendation is that no one strip should take more than 8 kilobytes uncompressed which with black and white images limits us to 65,536 pixels in a single strip.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>A multiple strip image is where horizontal blocks of the image are stored together. More than one stip is joined vertically to make the entire bitmap. Figure 2 shows this concept.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>A tiled image is like your bathroom wall, it is composed of tiles. This representation is show in Figure 3, and is useful for extremely large images -- this is especially true when you might only want to manipulate a small portion of the image at any one time.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>
Tiled images are comparatively uncommon, so I will focus on stripped images in this chapter. Remember as we go along, that the single stripped case is merely a subset of a multiple strip images.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Infrastructure for reading</title>
<para>
The most important thing to remember when reading in TIFF images is to be flexible. The example below has the same basic concepts as the writing example above, with the major difference being that it needs to deal with many possible input images. Apart from stripping and tiling, the most important thing to remember to be flexible about is photometric interpretation. Luckily, with black and white images there are only two photometric interpretations to worry about (with colour and to a certain extent grayscale images there are many more).
</para>

<para>
What is photometric interpretation? Well, the representation of the image in the buffer is really a very arbitary thing. I might code my bitmaps so that 0 means black (TIFFTAG_MINISBLACK), whilst you might find black being 1 (TIFFTAG_MINISWHITE) more convenient. TIFF allows both, so our code has to be able to handle both cases. In the example below, I have assumed that the internal buffers need to be in MINISWHITE, so we will convert images which are in MINISBLACK.
</para>

<para>
The other big thing to bear in mind is fillorder (whether the first bit in the byte is the highest value, or the lowest). The example below also handles both of these correctly. I have assumed that we want the buffer to have the most significant bit first. TIFF images can be either big endian or little endian, but libtiff handles this for us. Thankfully, libtiff also supports the various compression algorithms without you having to worry about those. These are by far the scariest area of TIFF, so it is still worth your time to use libtiff.

  }

    if((count + 1) % (width / 8) == 0) printf("\n");
    else printf(" ");
  }

  TIFFClose(image);
}
</programlisting>

<para>
This code works by first opening the image and checking that it is one that we can handle. It then reads in all the strip for the image, and appends them together in one large memory block. If required, it also flips bits until the photometric interpretation the one we handle, and deals with having to swap bits if the fillorder is wrong. Finally, our sample outputs the image as a series of lines composed of hex values. Remember that each of the values represents 8 pixels in the actual image.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<para>
In this chapter I have shown you how to write and read some simple black and white images using libtiff. There are of course more issues that can be dealt with to have the perfect code, but being aware of the issues is the first step. Finally, before you leap off and start coding with libtiff, remember to put some thought into what compression algorithm you should be using for your images -- group 4 fax is great for black and white, but what you use for color really depends on your needs.

<title>Abstract</title>
<para>		
TIFF is an extremely common, but quite complex raster image format. Libtiff is a standard implementation of the TIFF specification, which is free and works on many operating systems. This article discusses some of the pitfalls of TIFF, and guides the reader through use of the libtiff library. This article provides examples on how to use libtiff for your grayscale and color imaging needs.
</para>

<sidebar>
<title>Did you read the previous article?</title>
<para>This article is a follow up to my previous article on black and white graphics programming with libtiff. This article covers grayscale and color imaging, but it assumes that you have read and understood the code from the black and white article. It might be helpful to refer to that article before going too far here.</para>
</sidebar>

<para>With this article, I will discuss some of the theory required to understand how the image data is stored for color and grayscale. This theory applies to all imaging formats. We'll then discuss some of the specifics of using libtiff.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Terminology</title>
<para>	
We need to get some terminology out of the way before we can discuss much. Images are made up of pixels. In black and white imaging, the pixel has one of two values -- 0 or 1. This can be represented in a single bit. For grayscale and color images however, the pixel needs to be able to store a much greater range of values -- if a pixel was to have 255 levels of gray, then we would need 8 bits to store that pixel. Each of these values is called a sample. TIFF expresses the size of the value in a tag called TIFFTAG_BITSPERSAMPLE. This will be 1 for black and white, and some larger number for grayscale.
</para>

<para>
For color images, we need to store even more information. For each pixel we will need to store a red, green, and blue value. Each of these values are stored in a separate 'sample'. Therefore, we will need to define TIFFTAG_SAMPLESPERPIXEL -- this will be 1 for black and white or grayscale, but will normally be 3 for color images. We also need to define the size of each sample, so you'll still need to set a value for TIFFTAG_BITSPERSAMPLE.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>Theory of color and grayscale storage</title>
<para>
The first thing that we need to understand to be able to support color and grayscale images is the format of the image data within memory. There are two main representations for color and grayscale images. I'll explain these by describing grayscale, and then extend it to color.
</para>

<sect2><title>Direct storage of pixel data</title>
<para>
If you think back to the way pixel information was stored in the black and white images from the previous article, the information was just in the strips. You can also do this with grayscale and color images. This representation of image data is quite inefficient, because for the scenario when the image has a solid background (for example), there are many pixels with the same value. If the pixel data is stored in the strips, then this value will waste a large amount of space.
</para>

<para>
Thankfully, there is a more efficient way to store image data. Imagine a simple four color 24 bit per pixel image. If we build a lookup table of the four color values (the 24 bit values which represent those colors), then we just need to store the relevant entry number of the color in the image strip itself. This can be done in only two bits, instead of the full 24. The maths looks something like this:
</para>

<para>
A 24 bit color image which is 1,000 by 1,000 pixels will take 24 million bits to store. The same image, if it was a four color image, would take 4,000,000 bits for the strip data, and 98 bits for the color table. Neither of these numbers includes header and footer information for the file format, and the numbers are for uncompressed bitmaps. The advantages of the lookup table should be obvious. There is a name for this style of lookup table, it is called a <emphasis>palette</emphasis> -- probably because of those things painters carry around.
</para>

<para>
This concept works for grayscale images as well. The only difference is that the colors in the palette are not just shades of gray.
</para>

<sidebar><title>Accumulating loss?</title>
<para>Why does the loss in lossy compression algorithms such as JPEG accumulate? Imagine that you compress an image using JPEG. You then need to add say a barcode to the image, so you uncompress the image, add the barcode, and recompress it. When the recompression occurs, then a new set of loss is introduced. You can imagine that if you do this enough, then you'll end up with an image which is a big blob.</para>

<para>Whether this is a problem depends on the type of your data. To test how much of a problem this is, I wrote a simple libtiff program which repeatedly uncompresses and recompresses an image. What I found was that with pictures, the data is much more resilient to repeated compression.</para>

<sect1><title>Writing a color image</title>
<para>
It time to show you how to write a color image to disc. Remember that this is a simple example, which can be elaborated on greatly.
</para>

<programlisting>
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
  TIFF *output;
  uint32 width, height;
  char *raster;

  // Open the output image
  if((output = TIFFOpen("output.tif", "w")) == NULL){
    fprintf(stderr, "Could not open outgoing image\n");
    exit(42);
  }

  // We need to know the width and the height before we can malloc
  width = 42;
  height = 42;

  if((raster = (char *) malloc(sizeof(char) * width * height * 3)) == NULL){
    fprintf(stderr, "Could not allocate enough memory\n");
    exit(42);
  }

  // Magical stuff for creating the image
  // ...

  // Write the tiff tags to the file
  TIFFSetField(output, TIFFTAG_IMAGEWIDTH, width);
  TIFFSetField(output, TIFFTAG_IMAGELENGTH, height);
  TIFFSetField(output, TIFFTAG_COMPRESSION, COMPRESSION_DEFLATE);
  TIFFSetField(output, TIFFTAG_PLANARCONFIG, PLANARCONFIG_CONTIG);
  <command>TIFFSetField(output, TIFFTAG_PHOTOMETRIC, PHOTOMETRIC_RGB);</command>
  TIFFSetField(output, TIFFTAG_BITSPERSAMPLE, 8);
  TIFFSetField(output, TIFFTAG_SAMPLESPERPIXEL, 3);

  // Actually write the image
  if(TIFFWriteEncodedStrip(output, 0, raster, width * height * 3) == 0){
    fprintf(stderr, "Could not write image\n");
    exit(42);
  }

  TIFFClose(output);
}
</programlisting>

<para>You can see from this code some of the things that we have discussed in theory. The image has three samples per pixel, each of eight bits. This means that the image is a 24 bit RGB image. If this was a black and white or grayscale image, then this value would be one. The tag PHOTOMETRIC_RGB says that the image data is stored within the strips themselves (as opposed to being paletted) -- more about this in a second.</para>

<sidebar><title>Other values for samples per pixel?</title>
<para>
In this example, we have three samples per pixel. If this was a black and white image, or a grayscale image, then we would have one sample per pixel. There are other valid values for here as well -- for instance, sometimes people will store a transparency value for a given pixel, which is called an alpha channel. This would result in having four samples per pixel. It is possible to have an arbitary number of samples per pixel, which is good if you need to pack in extra information about a pixel. <emphasis>Note that doing this can break image viewers which make silly assumptions -- I once had to write code for a former employer to strip out alpha channels and the like so that their PDF generator wouldn't crash.</emphasis>
</para>
</sidebar>

<para>The other interesting thing to discuss here is the planar configuration of the image. Here we have specifed PLANARCONFIG_CONTIG, which means that the red green and blue information for a given pixel is grouped together in the strips of image data. The other option is PLANARCONFIG_SEPARATE, where the red samples for the image are stored together, then the blue samples, and finally the green samples.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>Writing a paletted color image</title>
<para>
So how do we write a paletted version of this image? Well, libtiff makes this really easy -- all we need to do is change the value of TIFFTAG_PHOTOMETRIC to PHOTOMETRIC_PALETTE. It's not really worth including an example in this article, given it's a one word change.</para>
</sect1>





<sect1><title>Reading a color image</title>
<para>
Now all we have to do is work out how to read other people's color and grayscale images reliably, and we're home free. Initially I was very tempted to not tell you about the TIFFReadRGBAStrip() and TIFFReadRGBBSTile() calls, which hide some of the potential ugliness from the caller. These functions have some limitations I'm not astoundingly happy with. To quote the TIFFReadRGBAStrip() man page:</para>

<!-- Is this the correct way to code a quote? -->
<programlisting>
   TIFFReadRGBAStrip reads a single strip of a strip-based image into memory,
   storing  the  result  in  the  user supplied RGBA raster. The raster is assumed to be an array of
   width   times   rowsperstrip   32-bit   entries,   where   width   is  the  width  of  the  image
   (TIFFTAG_IMAGEWIDTH) and rowsperstrip is the maximum lines in a strip (TIFFTAG_ROWSPERSTRIP).

   The  strip  value  should  be  the  strip  number  (strip  zero  is the first) as returned by the
   TIFFComputeStrip function, but always for sample 0.

   Note  that  the  raster  is  assume  to  be  organized  such  that the pixel at location (x,y) is
   raster[y*width+x];  with  the  raster  origin in the lower-left hand corner of the strip. That is
   bottom  to  top  organization. When reading a partial last strip in the file the last line of the
   image will begin at the beginning of the buffer.

   Raster  pixels  are  8-bit packed red, green, blue, alpha samples. The macros TIFFGetR, TIFFGetG,
   TIFFGetB,  and  TIFFGetA  should  be used to access individual samples. Images without Associated
   Alpha matting information have a constant Alpha of 1.0 (255).

   See  the TIFFRGBAImage(3T) page for more details on how various image types are converted to RGBA
   values.

<command>NOTES</command>

   Samples must be either 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bits. Colorimetric samples/pixel must be either 1, 3, or
   4 (i.e. SamplesPerPixel minus ExtraSamples).

   Palette  image  colormaps that appear to be incorrectly written as 8-bit values are automatically
   scaled to 16-bits.

   TIFFReadRGBAStrip  is  just  a wrapper around the more general TIFFRGBAImage(3T) facilities. It's
   main  advantage  over  the similar TIFFReadRGBAImage() function is that for large images a single
   buffer  capable  of  holding  the  whole  image doesn't need to be allocated, only enough for one
   strip. The TIFFReadRGBATile() function does a similar operation for tiled images.
</programlisting>

<para>There are a couple of odd things about this function -- it defines (0, 0) to be in a different location from all the other code that we have been writing. In all the previous code we have written, the (0, 0) point has been in the top left of the image. This call defines (0, 0) to be in the bottom left. The other limitation to be aware of is that not all valid values for bits per sample are supported. If you find these quirks unacceptable, then remember that you can still use TIFFReadEncodedStrip() in the same manner that we did for the black and white images in the previous article...</para>

<programlisting>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
  TIFF *image;
  uint32 width, height, *raster;
  tsize_t stripSize;
  unsigned long imagesize, c, d, e;

  // Open the TIFF image
  if((image = TIFFOpen(argv[1], "r")) == NULL){
    fprintf(stderr, "Could not open incoming image\n");
    exit(42);
  }

  // Find the width and height of the image
  TIFFGetField(image, TIFFTAG_IMAGEWIDTH, &lt;width);
  TIFFGetField(image, TIFFTAG_IMAGELENGTH, &lt;height);
  imagesize = height * width + 1;
  
  if((raster = (uint32 *) malloc(sizeof(uint32) * imagesize)) == NULL){
    fprintf(stderr, "Could not allocate enough memory\n");
    exit(42);
  }

  // Read the image into the memory buffer
  if(TIFFReadRGBAStrip(image, 0, raster) == 0){
    fprintf(stderr, "Could not read image\n");
    exit(42);
  }

  <command>// Here I fix the reversal of the image (vertically) and show you how to get the color values from each pixel</command>
  d = 0;
  for(e = height - 1; e != -1; e--){
    for(c = 0; c < width; c++){
      // Red = TIFFGetR(raster[e * width + c]);
      // Green = TIFFGetG(raster[e * width + c]);
      // Blue = TIFFGetB(raster[e * width + c]);
    }
  }

  free(raster);
  TIFFClose(image);
}
</programlisting>
</sect1>




<sect1><title>Advanced topics</title>
<para>
Well, now that we understand how to read and write basically any image format we can think of, there are two other things we should quickly discuss.</para>

<sect2><title>Storing TIFF data in places other than files</title>
<para>
All of these examples that I have included to this point have read and written with files. There are many scenarios when you wouldn't want to store your image data in a file, but would still want to use libtiff and tiff. For example, you might have customer pictures for id cards, and these would be stored in a database.
</para>

<para>
The example which I am most familiar with is PDF documents. In PDF files, you can embed images into the document. These images can be in a subset of TIFF if desired, and TIFF is quite clearly the choice for black and white images.
</para>

<sidebar><title>An expanded example</title>
<para>If you need more information about hooking the file input and output functions within libtiff than this article allows, then have a look at the images.c file in Panda, my PDF library. The web pages for Panda can be found at http://www.stillhq.com/cgi-bin/getpage?area=panda&lt;page=index.htm.</para>
</sidebar>

<para>libtiff allows you to replace the file input and output functions in the library with your own. This is done with the TIFFClientOpen() method. Here's an example (please note this code wont compile, and is just to describe the main concepts:</para>

<programlisting>
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

// Function prototypes
static tsize_t libtiffDummyReadProc (thandle_t fd, tdata_t buf, tsize_t size);
static tsize_t libtiffDummyWriteProc (thandle_t fd, tdata_t buf, tsize_t size);
static toff_t libtiffDummySeekProc (thandle_t fd, toff_t off, int i);
static int libtiffDummyCloseProc (thandle_t fd);

// We need globals because of the callbacks (they don't allow us to pass state)
char *globalImageBuffer;
unsigned long globalImageBufferOffset;

// This mutex keeps the globals safe by ensuring only one user at a time
pthread_mutex_t convMutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

<command>...</command>

TIFF *conv;

// Lock the mutex
pthread_mutex_lock (&lt;convMutex);

globalImageBuffer = NULL;
globalImageBufferOffset = 0;

// Open the dummy document (which actually only exists in memory)
conv = TIFFClientOpen ("dummy", "w", (thandle_t) - 1, libtiffDummyReadProc,
			libtiffDummyWriteProc, libtiffDummySeekProc,
			libtiffDummyCloseProc, NULL, NULL, NULL);

// Setup the image as if it was any other tiff image here, including setting tags

<command>...</command>

// Actually do the client open
TIFFWriteEncodedStrip (conv, 0, stripBuffer, imageOffset);

// Unlock the mutex
pthread_mutex_unlock (&lt;convMutex);

...

/////////////////// Callbacks to libtiff

<command>...</command>

static tsize_t
libtiffDummyReadProc (thandle_t fd, tdata_t buf, tsize_t size)
{
  // Return the amount of data read, which we will always set as 0 because
  // we only need to be able to write to these in-memory tiffs
  return 0;
}

static tsize_t
libtiffDummyWriteProc (thandle_t fd, tdata_t buf, tsize_t size)
{
  // libtiff will try to write an 8 byte header into the tiff file. We need
  // to ignore this because PDF does not use it...
  if ((size == 8) && (((char *) buf)[0] == 'I') && (((char *) buf)[1] == 'I')
     && (((char *) buf)[2] == 42))
    {
    // Skip the header -- little endian
    }
  else if ((size == 8) && (((char *) buf)[0] == 'M') &&
       (((char *) buf)[1] == 'M') && (((char *) buf)[2] == 42))
    {
    // Skip the header -- big endian
    }
  else
    {
    // Have we done anything yet?
    if (globalImageBuffer == NULL)
	if((globalImageBuffer = (char *) malloc (size * sizeof (char))) == NULL)
        {
          fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation error\n");
          exit(42);
        }

    // Otherwise, we need to grow the memory buffer
    else
	{
	  if ((globalImageBuffer = (char *) realloc (globalImageBuffer,
						     (size * sizeof (char)) +
						     globalImageBufferOffset)) == NULL)
	    fprintf(stderr, "Could not grow the tiff conversion memory buffer\n");
            exit(42);
	}

    // Now move the image data into the buffer
    memcpy (globalImageBuffer + globalImageBufferOffset, buf, size);
    globalImageBufferOffset += size;
    }

  return (size);
}

static toff_t
libtiffDummySeekProc (thandle_t fd, toff_t off, int i)
{
  // This appears to return the location that it went to
  return off;
}

static int
libtiffDummyCloseProc (thandle_t fd)
{
  // Return a zero meaning all is well
  return 0;
}

<sect2><title>Converting color to grayscale</title>
<para>
How do you convert color images to grayscale? Well, my instant answer when I first had to do this was to just average the red, green and blue values. That answer is wrong. The reality is that the human eye is much better at seeing some colors than others. To get an accurate grayscale representation, you need to apply different coefficients to the color samples. Appropraite coefficients are 0.299 for red, 0.587 for green and 0.114 for blue.</para>

<sect1><title>Conclusion</title>

In this article we've discussed how to program with libtiff for grayscale and color images. I've shown you some sample code which should help to get you started. You should now know enough to have a great time coding with libtiff. Thanks for taking the time to read this article.</para>

</para>

<sect1><title>Encrypting images can have unexpected effects</title>
<para>
DES in Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode is a particularly poor choice of cryptography for image files. This is because ECB mode implements a lookup table between the unencrypted value and the encrypted value. This results in a known input value turning into the same output value over and over. This can have some interesting bluring effects, but wont obscure the image contents. An example will help this make more sense -- figure 1 is the logo for the company I am currently working for. I took this image, and ran it through some DES ECB code and produced figure 2.
</para>

<title>The TOWER corporate logo</title>

You can see that whilst the image has certainly changed, the contents of the image has not really been obscured. TODO more
