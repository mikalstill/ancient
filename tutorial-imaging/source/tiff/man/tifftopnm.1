.IX tifftopnm
.SH NAME
tifftopnm \- convert a TIFF file into a portable anymap
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tifftopnm
\fR[\fB--alphaout=\fR{\fIalpha-filename\fR,\fB-\fR}]
.RB [ --headerdump ]
.I tiff-filename

.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a TIFF file as input.
.IX TIFF
Produces a portable anymap as output.
The type of the output file depends on the input file - if it's
black & white, generates a
.I pbm
file;
if it's grayscale, generates a
.I pgm
file; otherwise, a
.I ppm
file.  The program tells you which type it is writing.
.PP
This program cannot read every possible TIFF file -- there are myriad
variations of the TIFF format.  However, it does understand monochrome
and gray scale, RGB, RGBA (red/green/blue with alpha channel), CMYK
(Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black ink color separation), and color palette
TIFF files.  An RGB file can have either single plane (interleaved)
color or multiple plane format.  The program reads 1-8 and 16
bit-per-sample input, the latter in either bigendian or littlendian
encoding.  Tiff directory information may also be either bigendian or
littendian.
.PP
One reason this program isn't as general as TIFF programs often are is
that it does not use the TIFFRGBAImageGet() function of the TIFF
library to read TIFF files.  Rather, it uses the more primitive
TIFFReadScanLine() function and decodes it itself.
.PP
There is no fundamental reason that this program could not read other
kinds of TIFF files; the existing limitations are mainly because no one
has asked for more.

The PNM output has the same maxval as the Tiff input, except that if
the Tiff input is colormapped (which implies a maxval of 65535) the
PNM output has a maxval of 255.  Though this may result in lost
information, such input images hardly ever actually have more color
resolution than a maxval of 255 provides and people often cannot deal
with PNM files that have maxval > 255.  By contrast, a non-colormapped
Tiff image that doesn't need a maxval > 255 doesn't 
.I have
a maxval > 255, so when we see a non-colormapped maxval > 255, we take
it seriously and produce a matching output maxval.

The 
.I tiff-filename
argument names the regular file that contains the Tiff image.  You
cannot use Standard Input or any other special file because the Tiff
library must be able to perform seeks on it.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI --alphaout= alpha-filename
.B tifftopnm 
creates a PGM (portable graymap) file containing the alpha channel
values in the input image.  If the input image doesn't contain an
alpha channel, the
.I alpha-filename
file contains all zero (transparent) alpha values.  If you don't specify
.BR --alphaout ,
.B tifftopnm
does not generate an alpha file, and if the input image has an alpha channel,
.B tifftopnm
simply discards it.

If you specify
.B -
as the filename, 
.B tifftopnm
writes the alpha output to Standard Output and discards the image.

See 
.BR pnmcomp (1)
for one way to use the alpha output file.
.TP
.B --headerdump
Dump TIFF file information to stderr.  This information may be useful 
in debugging TIFF file conversion problems.  
.PP
All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
