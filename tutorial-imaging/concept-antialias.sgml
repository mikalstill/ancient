<para>
Imagine that you are drawing a triangle across an image (or on the screen for that matter). The triangle is sometimes going to cross pixels in a way which makes them not totally turned on. Have a look at the figure below to see what I mean...
</para>

<slidetext>
<li>Imagine that you're drawing a triangle
<li>There are some pixels which are only going to be half on...

<execute><cmd>img</cmd><args>antialias-figure1.png</args></execute>
</figure>
</slideinclude>

<para>
If we only have a black and white image, then we'll end up with an image like the one in the figure below. I am sure you'll agree that this isn't a very good representation of the side of the triangle.
</para>

<slidetext>
<li>This results in a black and white image which looks quite gross...
</slidetext>

<slidebreak>

<slideinclude>
<figure><title>A triangle with only black pixels</title>
<execute><cmd>img</cmd><args>antialias-figure2.png</args></execute>
</figure>
</slideinclude>

<para>
Anti-aliasing is when we try to correct for this problem by inserting some gray pixels. In the figure below, we have given some of the pixels a gray value which is based on how much of the pixel is <quote>filled</quote> with the triangle.
</para>

<slidetext>
<li>We can try to correct this by making some pixels half black
  <ul>
  <li>(Assuming we can have a grayscale version of the image)
  </ul>
</slidetext>

<slidebreak>

<slideinclude>
<figure><title>A triangle with gray scale pixels</title>
<execute><cmd>img</cmd><args>antialias-figure3.png</args></execute>
</figure>
</slideinclude>

<para>
The triangle might be a little clearer without the grid lines.
</para>

<slidebreak>

<slidetext>
<li>Without the gridlines...

<slideinclude>
<figure><title>Anti-aliased triangle without grid lines</title>
<execute><cmd>img</cmd><args>antialias-figure4.png</args></execute>
</figure>
</slideinclude>

<para>
For comparison, there is the triangle we started with...
</para>

<figure><title>The original triangle</title>
<execute><cmd>img</cmd><args>antialias-figure5.png</args></execute>
</figure>

<para>
So, in summary, anti-aliasing is the process of turning on some extra gray scale pixels to improve the look of shapes we are drawing...
