<title>Abstract</title>
<para>
This paper discusses <command>genstruct</command> a structure serialization methodology for C and C++ development. It has been developed by Dr Andrew Tridgell, who currently works for Quantum. <command>genstruct</command> is extremely powerful, and the ability to serialize in memory data structures has some interesting side effects -- for instance the ability to upgrade code bases without incurring a service outage.

<sect1><title>The meeting</title>
<para>
<command>genstruct</command> is a C based data dumping package which Dr Andrew Tridgell discussed at the June 2002 Canberra Linux User's Group meeting on 27 June 2002. It finds it's roots in the perl <command>Data::Dumper</command> and Java string marshaling methodologies, and is an extremely powerful tool for development. Dr Tridgell originally developed <command>genstruct</command> for the <command>Samba</command> project. In this paper I discuss points Dr Tridgell raised in his talk in further detail.

<sect1><title>Response to the talk</title>
<para>
Dr Tridgell is obviously a very talented software engineer, and his enthusiasm is contagious. He is also very obviously experienced at talking to audiences (he gives a very large number of conference presentations), and he normally speaks off the cuff.
