CHANGE LOG
----------
 v1.09 (20-Sep-2000)     Tidied up example and my own templates and moved
                         random.pl to a utils/ directory. Added dilbert.pl
                         and fixed small bugs in EXEC.

 v1.08 (09-Feb-2000)     Doh! INCLUDE didn't work for multiple includes.
                         Added some more explanation to README and changed
                         INCLUDE to assume working directory as output dir.

 v1.07 (07-Feb-2000)     Added <!--INCLUDE "<file>"--> command. Rewrote the
                         help file.

 v1.06 (19-Jan-2000)     New $NUMLINKS parameter allows you to see how
                         busy the subsection is. If a file already exists
                         intelligently handle it.

 v1.05 (18-Jan-2000)     Description field of links can now be used (but
                         not of sections) and new examples included.

 v1.04 (04-Jan-2000)     New release: added feature so that not all links
                         need go into the contents page.

 v1.03 (03-Jan-2000)     New features in v1.02 didn't entirely work (too busy
                         rushing out a release) - private sections weren't
                         handled properly and the contents page would miss out
                         the last section. Only released for limited testing.
                         
 v1.02 (02-Jan-2000)     Added private links and an alphabetical contents page
                         (suggested by David S. Cargo).

 v1.01 (16-Dec-1999)     Announced on Freshmeat and some minor bug fixes,
                         this is the first "proper" version.

 v1.00 (15-Dec-1999)     Initial release.
