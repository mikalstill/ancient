* Work out how to do include dependancies in automake
* cepDatae currently returns incorrect display dates (they're off by a couple of days)
* operator= to convert string to wxString?
* define a with wx macro for the ui target only, the current way is broken...
* tooltips
* documentation as HTML (perhaps in docbook so we can have a printed manual as well)
* autoconf tests for X libraries always fail (are they needed at all?)
* reinstate the config for error display
* BAHR dataset breaks the UI on zoomed view in Z dimension. Is this because of the negative values?
