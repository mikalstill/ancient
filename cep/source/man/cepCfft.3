.SH NAME
cepCfft \- Computes forward and inverse fft on a 2 or 3D Matrix or an array.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
 #include <math.h>
 #include <cepCfft.h>
 typedef complex<double> Complex;
 
 ...fill array...
 
 cepCfft<Complex> FFT( FFTsize ); // build an operator object
 // The constructor builds tables and places them
 //in the object.
 
 To perform FFT on an array:
 
 Complex Array[FFTsize]; 
 ...
 FFT.fft( Array ); // forward transform
 FFT.ifft( Array ); // reverse transform.
 
 To perform FFT on a matrix:
 
 Complex cepMatrix <Complex> myMatrix(rows,cols,tables);
 //see cepMatrix for further information on Matrices.
 
 ...fill myMatrix...
 
 myMatrix = FFT.matrixFft (myMatrix, 1); //forward transform
 myMatrix = FFT.matrixFft (myMatrix, 0); //inverse transform
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
<para>This class can be used in 2 ways..The first is as originally intended. That is, computing an FFT on an array of data. The
second is spceific to GDMS. The FFT is computed on a matrix of data, with the results returned in a complex matrix. The FFT can be
in either direction as specified in the function call.
</para>
<para> 
<command>FFTobject.matrixFft (myMatrix, direction);</command>
Computes the FFT on the matrix in the direction specified.
<command>myMatrix</command> The matrix containing the data to be FFT'd
<command>direction</command>. int direction. 1 for forward 0 for inverse.
</para>
<para>
<command>FFTobject.fft(complexArray);</command>
Computes a forward FFT on the array passed. The results are written to the same array.
<command>complexArray</command> 
The array of type complex containing the data to be FFT'd.
</para>
<para>
<command>FFTobject.ifft(complexArray);</command>
Computes an inverse FFT on the array passed. The results are written to the same array.
<command>complexArray</command> The array of type complex containing the data to be FFT'd.
</para>
<para>
<command>FFTobject.getError();</command>
Returns m_error which holds the error state from cepMatrix. Is the error.IsReal() the
processing must stop.
</para>
