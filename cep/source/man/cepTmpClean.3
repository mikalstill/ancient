.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
<command>GDMS</command> creates temporary files for the various graphs that it draws. Normally these temporary files are stored in /tmp. Over only a few graph executions, it is possible to have a fairly large number of temporary files, which might cause the filesystem which /tmp is stored on to run out of disc space.</para>
<para>
This class automates the removal of these old files, and is called whenever the interactive version of <command>GDMS</command> starts up.
</para>
<para>
This class is extremely easy to use. Please refer to the example below for more details.
