<sect2><title>commands</title>
<para>
This tag will display a menu of the commands available in the current context -- for example, when the Internet interface first starts, it will list the open command. Commands which are not available, but are normally available will appear in a disabled style. This results in a list of commands which is consistent, and therefore reduces the potential for user confusion.
</para>

<para>
An example use is as follows:
</para>

<programlisting>
&amp;{commands};
</programlisting>

<para>
The display of the command menu is altered by the following configuration file entries:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis>commandentry</emphasis>: this HTML snippet is used for enabled commands</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>discommandentry</emphasis>: this HTML snippet is used for disabled commands</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
For example, these configuration entries ship by default with the GDMS Internet interface:
</para>

<programlisting>
# This line is simple HTML used for format the command entries,
# %s is the name of the command (including link HTML)
$commandentry = "&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"AAAAAA\"&gt;%s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;tr&gt;";

# This line is used for commands which aren't available...
$discommandentry = "&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"EEEEEE\"&gt;
  &lt;font color=\"777777\"&gt;%s&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;";
</programlisting>
