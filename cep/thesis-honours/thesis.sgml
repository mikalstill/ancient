<sect1><title>Motivation</title>
<para>
At the time that the <command>Geodetic Data Modeling System</command> (GDMS) implementation project was initiated, several of the potential users expressed a desire for the application to be available over the Internet. There are a variety of reasons that this type of functionality is enticing -- the main ones for GDMS are that it allows casual users to ability to analyse data, whilst not having to maintain their own copies of the datasets, and it allows users who would normally use the X windows interface to the application to access data whilst <quote>in the field</quote>, or otherwise physically separated from their normal research location.
</para>

<para>
Initially, it was though that a Internet interface to GDMS was outside the achievable scope of the project for 2002. However, as the year progressed, it became clear to me that implementing a Internet interface was indeed achievable, and would add genuinely useful functionality to the application. Hence this honours extension was undertaken.

<chapter><title>Implementation rationale</title>
<sect1><title>Presentation of the user interface</title>
<para>
In accordance with Internet user interface design best practise, the GDMS Internet interface presents a fully configurable user interface. This is implemented by providing extension tags to those which are available in the standard HTML specification (Raggett, Le Hors, &amp; Jacobs 1999).
</para>

<para>
The GDMS Internet interface follows the recommendations of the most recent HTML specification at the time of development for the insertion of scripting tags into HTML source files (Raggett, Le Hors, &amp; Jacobs 1999). Further documentation on the GDMS Internet interface tags available can be found in Appendix One of this document.

<sect1><title>Selection of an image format for graph display</title>
<para>
Much though was expended on which image format to use for the plots displayed in the GDMS Internet interface. There are advantages and disadvantages to all the formats available at the time of writing this document. The following formats were considered for the GDMS Internet interface:
</para>

<sect2><title>TIFF</title>
<para>
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a raster (bitmap) image format which was originally produced by Aldus and Microsoft. Aldus was later acquired by Adobe, who manage the 
TIFF specification to this day. At the time of writing, the current version of the TIFF specification is TIFF version 6.0 (Adobe 1992).
</para>

<para>
The main advantage of the TIFF image format is that it is extemely mature. It has a large selection of options to ease the development of imaging software, for example the developer can use which ever endian representation is convenient for them, as well as such fundamental parameters as photometric interpretation (whether a high value is lighter or darker than a low value for a given colour sample within a pixel) (Adobe 1992). There is also a stable, well supported Open Source application programmers interface available to manage creation and interpretation of images within the TIFF format (Warmerdam &amp; Welles 2002). The interface to this library does not frequently change, which is also an advantage for future portability of the GDMS Internet interface.
</para>

<para>
However, some of these very advantages lead to the disadvantages that the TIFF format suffers from. Because the content of the file is so loosely specified, it is quite hard to write an application which can correctly decode all possible TIFF format images. This has resulted in their being only a few high quality TIFF viewing applications being available. The relative difficultly of implementing a TIFF decoder has also resulted in the web browser support for TIFF images being very poor (Bither 2002)

<chapter><title>Appendix One: GDMS Internet interface scripting elements</title>
<sect1><title>Introduction</title>
<para>
This appendix documents the various tags which are implemented by the GDMS Internet interface in addition to the standard HTML tags normally available. All of these tags are within the scripting namespace provided by HTML 4.01 (Raggett, Le Hors, &amp; Jacobs 1999).
