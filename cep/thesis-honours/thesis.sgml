<sect1><title>Motivation</title>
<para>
At the time that the <command>Geodetic Data Modeling System</command> (GDMS) implementation project was initiated, several of the potential users expressed a desire for the application to be available over the Internet. There are a variety of reasons that this type of functionality is enticing -- the main ones for GDMS are that it allows casual users to ability to analyse data, whilst not having to maintain their own copies of the datasets, and it allows users who would normally use the X windows interface to the application to access data whilst <quote>in the field</quote>, or otherwise physically separated from their normal research location.
</para>

<para>
Initially, it was though that a Internet interface to GDMS was outside the achievable scope of the project for 2002. However, as the year progressed, it became clear to me that implementing a Internet interface was indeed achievable, and would add genuinely useful functionality to the application. Hence this honours extension was undertaken.
</para>

<sect1><title>Outcome</title>
<para>
This document describes the design process and implementation of the GDMS Internet interface, and perl application intended to operate under the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) offered by most modern web servers. This application allows the online use of almost all of the functionality available under the X windows GDMS system.

<sect1><title>Presentation of the user interface</title>
<para>
In accordance with Internet user interface design best practise, the GDMS Internet interface presents a fully configurable user interface. This is implemented by providing extension tags the those which are available in the standard HTML specification (Raggett, Le Hors, &amp; Jacobs 1999).
</para>

<para>
The GDMS Internet interface follows the recommendations of the most recent HTML specification at the time of development for the insertion of scripting tags into HTML source files (Raggett, Le Hors, &amp; Jacobs 1999). Further documentation on the GDMS Internet interface tags available can be found in Appendix One of this document.

<chapter><title>Appendix One: GDMS Internet interface scripting elements</title>
<sect1><title>Introduction</title>
<para>
This appendix documents the various tags which are implemented by the GDMS Internet interface in addition to the standard HTML tags normally available. All of these tags are within the scripting namespace provided by HTML 4.01 (Raggett, Le Hors, &amp; Jacobs 1999).

<chapter><title>Appendix Four: A sample configuration file</title>
<para>
This appendix details a sample configuration file for the GDMS Internet interface. This file should be stored in the same directory as the GDMS CGI script. It should also be noted that the <quote>.cep</quote> configuration file that would normally reside in a user's home directory should also be in the same directory as the GDMS CGI script.
</para>

<para>
The easiest way to create a suitable <quote>.cep</quote> configuration file is to run GDMS as any user, configure it so that you are happy with the graph output, and then copy that .cep file to the right location. Don't forget to update the permissions so that the user the web server is running as has read and write permissions on the file.
