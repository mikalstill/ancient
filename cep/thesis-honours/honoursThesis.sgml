<sect1><title>Motivation</title>
<para>
At the time that the <command>Geodetic Data Modeling System</command> (GDMS) implementation project was initiated, several of the potential users expressed a desire for the application to be available over the Internet. There are a variety of reasons that this type of functionality is enticing -- the main ones for GDMS are that it allows casual users to ability to analyse data, whilst not having to maintain their own copies of the datasets, and it allows users who would normally use the X windows interface to the application to access data whilst <quote>in the field</quote>, or otherwise physically separated from their normal research location.
</para>

<para>
Initially, it was though that a Internet interface to GDMS was outside the achievable scope of the project for 2002. However, as the year progressed, it became clear to me that implementing a Internet interface was indeed achievable, and would add genuinely useful functionality to the application. Hence this honours extension was undertaken.

<chapter><title>Implementation rationale</title>
<sect1><title>Presentation of the user interface</title>
<para>
In accordance with Internet user interface design best practise, the GDMS Internet interface presents a fully configurable user interface. This is implemented by providing extension tags to those which are available in the standard HTML specification (Raggett, Le Hors, &amp; Jacobs 1999).
</para>

<para>
The GDMS Internet interface follows the recommendations of the most recent HTML specification at the time of development for the insertion of scripting tags into HTML source files (Raggett, Le Hors, &amp; Jacobs 1999).

<chapter><title>Appendix One: GDMS Internet interface scripting elements</title>
<sect1><title>Introduction</title>
<para>
This appendix documents the various tags which are implemented by the GDMS Internet interface in addition to the standard HTML tags normally available. All of these tags are within the scripting namespace provided by HTML 4.01 (Raggett, Le Hors, &amp; Jacobs 1999).
</para>

<sect2><title>commands</title>
<para>
This tag will display a menu of the commands available in the current context -- for example, when the Internet interface first starts, it will list the open command. Commands which are not available, but are normally available will appear in a disabled style. This results in a list of commands which is consistent, and therefore reduces the potential for user confusion.
</para>

<para>
An example use is as follows:
</para>

<programlisting>
&{commands};
</programlisting>

<para>
The display of the command menu is altered by the following configuration file entries:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis>commandentry</emphasis>: this HTML snippet is used for enabled commands</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>discommandentry</emphasis>: this HTML snippet is used for disabled commands</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
For example, these configuration entries ship by default with the GDMS Internet interface:
</para>

<programlisting>
# This line is simple HTML used for format the command entries,
# %s is the name of the command (including link HTML)
$commandentry = "&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"AAAAAA\"&gt;%s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;tr&gt;";

# This line is used for commands which aren't available...
$discommandentry = "&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=\"EEEEEE\"&gt;
  &lt;font color=\"777777\"&gt;%s&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;";
</programlisting>
