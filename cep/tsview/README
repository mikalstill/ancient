+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++TSVIEW V0.1+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Simon McClusky and Tom Herring.

Tsview is a matlab script for plotting and editing time series. Tsview displays
the 3 componets of site position (NEU) along with a list time series found in
the current directory available for viewing and editing, and GUI buttons for 
manipulating the time series.

The input data format for tsview are multibase files created by the kf program
multibase. Multibase must be run using the -year flag, with NO -max_sig options
selected.

To use tsview: 
(1) Open a matlab session on you workstation. Start the matlab session in the 
directory containing the mb_* files you want to edit. [ matlab ]
(2) In the matlab shell opened in step 1, set the path to the tsview 
program. [ Example: addpath /home/simon/matlab ]
(3) Now start the tsview GUI. [ tsview ] The tsview GUI should open and 
display a list of sites available for editing in a column on the left side of 
the GUI.
(4) Select a site from the site list using the left mouse button and click the Load 
button with the left mouse button. The N, E, and U time series should be loaded and 
plotted in the 3 panels on the right hand side of the GUI.
(5) Now you are free to manipulate the time series as desired. Below is a summary 
of what each of the GUI buttons do.

  Load - Load or reload the time series of site highlighted in the site list box.

  Append - Append data to the current plot. Use this feature to plot the complete 
           time series of a site offset by an earthquake and renamed in GLOBK. 

  Detrend - Display the time series with a first order polynomial (rate) removed
            The WRMS, NRMS, number of observations, Rate, and size of jumps at any 
            marked breaks will be displayed for each component of the time series 
            at the top of each panel. This information is also printed to the matlab 
            shell.
 
  Edit - Using the left mouse button you can choose a single point in the time 
         series to be marked for removal. Using the right mouse button you can 
         select multiple points for removal. Note selecting a point to edit out 
         in any of the 3 (N,E,U) panels means it will be marked for removal in all 
         3 panels. Points selected will be marked with an X. Selecting the detrend 
         button recomputes statistics, and replots the data with the selected 
         points removed.

  Block Edit - This feature allows you to select a region of points to be marked for
               editing. Click and hold down the left mouse button, while draging the 
               mouse over the region of points you would like removed from the plot.
               Releasing the left mouse button will select the points enclosed 
               within the rectangular region you scribe. As with the edit button,
               selecting points to edit out in any of the 3 (N,E,U) panels means they 
               will be marked for removal in all 3 panels. Points selected will 
               be marked with an X. Selecting the detrend button recomputes 
               statistics, and replots the data with the selected points removed.

  Break - This button allows you to select one (left button) or more (right button)
          places to break the time series. After placeing the breaks at the 
          locations you want, pressing the detrend button will cause the time
          series, rate, break jumps, and statistics to be recalculated and 
          displayed on the GUI and on the matlab shell. The breaks are displayed 
          on the same line as the time series statistics and rate.

  Zoom - The zoom button allows you to zoom in or out on a single panel. Zoom in 
         by clicking the zoom button, then clicking with the left mouse button on 
         the region of the time series you would like to zoom in on. Clicking with 
         the right mouse button will zoom out.

  Span - This button allows you to display a descrete span of the time series. 
         Click the span button, then click and hold down the left mouse button at 
         the left side of the segment of data you would like to span, drag the 
         mouse to the right side of the segment of data required, and release the 
         button, the span selected will now be plotted. Note all 3 panels will 
         display the same span of data. You can now use and of the edit, or break
         buttons as you could on the entire span. Clicking detrend will apply any 
         changes you make on the spaned section, then replot the entire time series 
         again.

  Save - Clicking the Save button will save in a file called output.file any of
         the changes you made to the timeseries (edits or breaks) in the globk .eq 
         file format, using the rename command to documet what changes you made to
         the time sereis.
