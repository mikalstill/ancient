<sect1><title>Introduction</title>
<para>
  This section aims to provide a reference for the functionality of the <command>GDMS</command>.
  The main functionality of this package is provided through the following menus.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>File Menu</title>

  <sect2><title>Opening a data set</title>
    <para>
      When the application is first run, you are presented with a blank window with File 
      and Help menus. To open a data set, open the <command>File</command> menu and select
      <command>Open</command>. This can also be done by using the keyboard shortcut
      <command>CTRL-O</command>.
    </para>

    <para>
      While a data set is being loaded, a progress window appears.

    <para>
      Once the data set has been loaded, the application looks like:
    </para>

     <figure><title>Loaded dataset.</title>

    </figure>


  </sect2>

  <sect2><title>Closing a dataset</title>
    <para>
      To close a dataset, select <command>File</command> - <command>Close</command>. Note that
      this will not terminate the application. To do do this, see <command>Exit</command> below.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2><title>Saving a data set</title>
    <para>
       To save a data set after processing, select <command>File</command> -
       <command>Save</command>. The following window appears.
    </para>

    <figure><title>Save As window.</title>
      <execute><cmd>img</cmd><args>gdmsSaveAs.png</args></execute>
    </figure>

    <para>
       Choose the desired location and file name and click <command>OK</command>.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2><title>Exit</title>
  <para>
   To exit the application, select <command>File</command> -> <command>Exit</command> or
   use the keyboard shortcut, <command>CTRL-Q</command>.
  </para>
  </sect2>

</sect1> <!--file menu -->

<sect1><title>Edit menu</title>
  <para>
     This functionality has not been included in this release. The Edit menu exists for future
     enhancements such as Undo, Redo and Delete.  The undo functionality however, is inherit
     due to the way <command>GDMS</command> creates a new dataset after every mathematical 
     operation.
  </para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>View menu</title>
  <para>
    The look and feel of the user interface can be configured to suit individual users using
    the <command>View Menu</command>. Please refer to the User Interface Configuration chapter
    for full details on these features.
  </para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>Maths</title>
  <para>
    The data processing functionality provided by the <command>GDMS</command> is provided in
    the <command>Maths</command> menu. All mathematical operations on a data set result in at
    least one additional dataset being created. This enables easy reference to both the original 
    and processed data for comparison. Furthermore, any dataset that can be viewed within the 
    application can be saved for future reference.
  </para>

  <sect2><title>Time Domain Analysis</title>

    <sect3><title>Least Squeares</title>
      <para>
        The only time domain modelling currently available is Least Squares regression. This 
        can be accessed by selecting <command>Maths</command> - <command>Least Squares</command>. 
        The available options in the least squares menu are <command>Variance 
        Co-variance</command> and <command>Random Walk</command>.
      </para>
      <sect4><title>Variance Co-variance</title>
        <sect5><title>Automatic Re-weighting</title>
          <para>
            When this option is presented, you are given the option of using the automatic
            re-weighting feature. If you choose to use automatic reweighting then
            our algorithms will weight out any outliers in the dataset, then output a
            least squares regression. The regression outputs two new data sets; the first shows
            the dataset with the least squares regression line with the weighted points
            rendered in a different colour. The second dataset loaded is the residuals, also with
            weighted out data points displayed in a different colour.
          </para>
        </sect5>

        <sect5><title>Manual Re-weighting</title>
          <para>
            If <command>NO</command> is selected when prompted for automatic re-weighting,
            the option is given to load a weighting matrix from file for each direction. If
            <command>NO</command> is selected here, a data range may be specified before
            continuing with the VCV analysis by pressing Do VCV. Selecting <command>YES</command>
            to load a matrix for a file will result in a prompt request on the file's location.
            Once a matrix is chosen, the analysis will again provide both the least squares
            and residual datasets.
          </para>
        </sect5>
      </sect4>

      <sect4><title>Random Walk</title>
        <para>
          Random walk functionality has not yet been activated in the <command>GDMS</command> engine. This is mostly implemented, however
          no agreement has yet been reached with regard to the exact format that this function will take.
        </para>

  <sect2><title>Interpolation</title>
    <para>
       The available options in the Interpolation menu are <command>Nearest Neighbour</command>, <command>Linear Interpolation</command>,
       <command>Natural Spline</command>, <command>Cubic Spline</command> and <command>Divided Differences</command>. To carry out
       interpolation, select the <command>Maths</command> menu followed by the <command>Interpolation</command> menu and from here
       select the desired method. Enter the required sample rate when prompted and click <command>OK</command> to proceed or
       <command>CANCEL</command> to return to the main window.
    </para>
  </sect2> <!-- interp -->

  <sect2><title>Windowing data</title>
    <para>
      The available options in the Windowing menu are <command>Rectangular</command>, <command>Hanning</command>,
      <command>Hamming</command>, <command>Blackman</command> and <command>Dolph-Chebyshev</command>. To window
      data, go to the <command>Maths</command> menu followed by the <command>Windowing</command> menu and from here select
      the desired method. Each method prompts for a window size and an overlap. The window size must be number satisfying
      <programlisting>size=2<superscript>n</superscript></programlisting> and the standard overlap is 50% of the window size.
      In addition, <command>Dolph-Chevyshev</command> prompts for the Normalised Transition Bandwidth, the values for which are
      restricted to the range 0.0 - 0.5. In application these numbers must be restricted to the range 0.02 -0.499 to avoid division
      by zero. Enter the information and click <command>OK</command> to proceed.
    </para>

    <sect3><title>Window selection</title>
      <para>
        When windowing is carried out on a dataset, all windows are displayed. For flexibility, the <command>GDMS</command>
        allows individual windows to be displayed. To do this, open the <command>goto</command> menu and navigate through
        the windows as desired.
      </para>
    </sect3>

  </sect2> <!-- windowing -->


  <sect2><title>Frequency Domain Analysis</title>
    <para>
      Select the Maths menu, select Fast Fourier Transform which will gernerate a PSD plot. Note, before successfully carrying out
      operations in the frequency domain, the data must be interpolated. The Failure to do so will
      result in an error message from the <command>GDMS</command>. The error message gives the first three dates
      int the dataset that caused the failure.
    </para>

<sect1><title>Help Menu</title>
  <para>
    In this release the Help menu contains only an About box. This is an area for future expansion.
