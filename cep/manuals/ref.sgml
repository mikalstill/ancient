<sect1><title>File Menu</title>

  <sect2><title>Opening a data set</title>
    <para>
      When the application is first run, you are presented with a skeleton window with File and Help menus. To open a
      data set, simply open the <command>File</command> menu and select <command>Open</command>, as shown below.
      This can also be achieved by using the keyboard shortcut <command>CTRL-O</command>.
    </para>

    <execute><cmd>todo</cmd><input>Show first opened with file open</input></execute>
    <para>
      While a data set is being loaded, a progress window appears.
    </para>

    <execute><cmd>todo</cmd><input>Show progress bar</input></execute>

    <para>
      Once the data set has been loaded, the application looks like:
    </para>

    <execute><cmd>todo</cmd><input>Show loaded data set</input></execute>

  <sect2><title>Closing a dataset</title>
    <para>
      To close a dataset, select <command>File</command> - <command>Close</command>. Note that
      this will not terminate the application. To do do this, see <command>Exit</command> below.
    </para>

<sect1><title>Edit menu</title>
  <para>
     Functionality here has not been included in this release. The Edit menu exists for future 
     enhancements such as Undo, Redo and Delete.
  </para>

<sect1><title>View menu</title>
  <para>
    The look and feel of the user interface can be configured to suit individual users from the <command>View 
    Menu</command>. Please refer to the User Interface Configuration chapter for full details on these features.

<sect1><title>Maths</title>
  <para>
    The data processing functionality provided bt the <command>GDMS</command> is provided in
    the <command>Maths</command> menu. All mathematical operations on a data set result in at
    least one additional dataset to be loaded. This enables easy reference to both the original and
    processed data for comparison. Furthermore, any dataset that can be viewed within the application
    can be saved and printed.  TODO!!!printed yes??
  </para>

  <execute><cmd>todo</cmd><input>Show maths window</input></execute>

  <sect2><title>Time Domain Analysis</title>
    <para>
      Ba Ba Black sheep have you any wool, yes sir yes sir 3 bags full..
      But you can't have it because in case you haven't noticed, there's a drought on.
    </para>

    <sect3><title>Least Squeares</title>
      <para>
        The available options in the least squares menu are Variance Co-variance and Random Walk.
      </para>
      <sect4><title>Variance Co-variance</title>
        <sect5><title>Automatic Re-weighting</title>
          <para>
            When this option is presented, you must then decide whether or not to use the automatic re-weighting feature.
	    If the answer is yes, two new data sets are loaded; the first shows the dataset with
	    the least squares regression line. The data points that were weighted out by the automatic
	    weighting procedure are shown in a different colour. The second dataset loaded, is that of
	    the residuals. Once again, the weighted out data points are displayed in a different colour and
	    can be seen on the zero line. TODO: Kristy check please.
          </para>
        </sect5>

        <sect5><title>Manual Re-weighting</title>
          <para>
            If <command>NO</command> is selected when prompted for automatic re-weighting, the option is given to load a
	    weighting matrix from file for each direction. If <command>NO</command> is selected here, a data range must be specified
	    before continueing with the VCV analysis. Selecting <command>YES</command> to load a matrix for a file will result
	    in a prompt requestion the file's location on disk. Once a matrix is chosen, poceding with the analysis
	    will again provide both the  least squares and reiduals datasets.
          </para>

      </sect4>

      <sect4><title>Random Walk</title>
        <para>
          Random walk functionality has not yet been plugged in to the <command>GDMS
	  </command> engine. This will occur when agreement in the time series analysis community is reached on a
	  file format.
        </para>

  <sect2><title>Interpolation</title>
    <para>
       The available options in the Interpolation menu are Nearest neighbour, linear interpolation, natural spline,
       cubic spline and divided differences. To carry out interpolation, go to the
       <command>Maths</command> menu followed by the <command>Interpolation</command> menu and from here select
       the desired method. Enter the desired sample rate when prompted and click <command>OK</command> to proceed or
       <command>CANCEL</command> to return to the main window.
    </para>

  <sect2><title>Windowing data</title>
    <para>
      The available options in the Windowing menu are Blackman, Chebychev, Hamming, Hanning and rectangular. To window
      data, go to the <command>Maths</command> menu followed by the <command>Windowing</command> menu and from here select
      the desired method. Each method promts for a window size and an overlap. In addition, <command>Chevychev</command>
      also prompts for the Normalised Transition Bandwidth. Enter the information and click <command>OK</command> to proceed.
    </para>

    <sect3><title>Window selection</title>
      <para>
        When windowing is carried ut on a dataset, all windows are displayed. For flexibility, the <command>GDMS</command>
        allows individual windows to be displayed. To do this, open the <command>goto</command> menu and navigate through
        the windows as desired.

  <sect2><title>Frequency Domain Analysis</title>
    <para>
      Select the Maths menu, select Fast Fourier Transform or PSD plot. Note, before successfully carrying out
      operations in the frequency domain, the data must be interpolated. The Failure to do so will
      result in an error message from the <command>GDMS</command>. The error message gives the first three dates
      int the dataset that caused the failure.
