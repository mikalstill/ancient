<sect1><title>Dependancies</title>
  <para>
    There are several dependencies that the user needs to be aware of whilst installing GDMS from source. These are
    wxWindows, mplot, pcre, and freetype. Each of these dependancies, and their version at the time that this manual
    was produced are documented below.
  </para>

  <para>
    <emphasis>
      Please note that for some of the dependancies, having a later version installed might not be sufficient.
      This depends on how many interface changes have been imposed by that dependancy author. Because the actual source
      of these dependancies is outside the control of the GDMS team, this might make installation of later versions harder.
      The versions which have been tested with GDMS are included in the contrib/ directory of the GDMS
      distribution.

  <para>
    The installation process for the <command>GDMS</command> is as follows:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Change to the source directory</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Type the following commands:
        <programlisting>
          ./configure
          make
          make install
        </programlisting>
        This will install the application to the default path, the prefix for which is currently
        <programlisting>/usr/local/</programlisting>. If your path is not set to search this location
        the this need to be done. Check the documentation for your specific opertating system for
        more information on how to do this.
