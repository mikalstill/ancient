This file describes how the documentation for GDMS is built.

Autodocbook:
 - this is used to turn formatted comments in code headers into "man pages" for the various classes
 - actually produces docbook SGML, which can be converted into man, info and HTML documentation pages
 - a GPL script available from http://www.stillhq.com

Docbooktools:
 - a series of simple scripts which extend the docbook SGML DTD to allow for dynamic generation of content
 - used to include the output of autodocbook into the manuals without needing manual cutting and pasting
 - this makes it easy to ensure the documentation is up to date
 - also allows for the pretty formatting of c code
 - and the inclusion of random other SGML files from places like the contrib directory
