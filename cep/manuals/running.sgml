<sect1><title>Running the <command>GDMS</command> with the GUI</title>
<para>
  The <command>GDMS</command> can be invoked in a number of ways. The first and most obvious, is to invoke the
  Graphical User Interface by simply typing:
</para>
<programlisting>
./gdms
</programlisting>

<para>
at the command line. The application is loaded and can be used intuitively like most other GUI based applications.
For further information on specific functionality, see the quick reference quide.
</para>

<sect1><title>Running the <command>GDMS</command> with arguments</title>
<para>
  The <command>GDMS</command> accepts command line arguments further increasing its flexibility. For example, a file name
  can be specified as an argument, avoiding having to open the file through the user interface once it has been invoked. 
  Once again the GUI is invoked and can be used in the normal manner, the difference being that data sets provided as
  arguments are already loaded.

<sect1><title>Batch Processing</title>
<para>
As the title suggests, the <command>GDMS</command> allows batch processing. This enables a batch of tasks to be carried
out, thus avoiding individual processing of data sets. The way this is done is by specifying a batch file name as an
argument to the <command>GDMS</command> command.
