<sect1><title>Running the <command>GDMS</command> with the GUI</title>
  <para>
    The <command>GDMS</command> can be invoked in a number of ways. The first and most obvious, is to invoke the
    Graphical User Interface. To run it in this mode, open a console and type
  </para>
  <programlisting>
  [user@localhost /home/user]$ gdms
  </programlisting>
  <para>
  The application is loaded and the user is presented with a window. For further information on specific functionality,
  see the quick reference quide.
  </para>

<sect1><title>Running the <command>GDMS</command> with arguments</title>
  <para>
    The <command>GDMS</command> also possesses the abilty to accept command line arguments. For example, a file name
    can be specified as an argument, avoiding having to open the file through the user interface once it has been invoked. 
    Once again the GUI is invoked and can be used in the normal manner, the difference being that data sets provided as
    arguments are already loaded.
  </para>
  <para>
    Command line arguemnts which are accepted are:
    <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para><programlisting>-b &lt;filename&gt;</programlisting>:
        the batch file name. This is only availble on the batch file interface</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para><programlisting>-d &lt;filename&gt;</programlisting>:
        opens a specified dataset</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para><programlisting>-e &lt;yes|no&gt;</programlisting>:
        sets the visibility of error messages</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para><programlisting>-x &lt;yes|no&gt;</programlisting>:
        sets the visibility of the North plot</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para><programlisting>-y &lt;yes|no&gt;</programlisting>: sets the visibility of the East plot</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para><programlisting>-z &lt;yes|no&gt;</programlisting>: sets the visibility of the Vertical plot</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>
</sect1>


<sect1><title>Batch Processing</title>
  <para>
  As the title suggests, the <command>GDMS</command> allows batch processing. This enables a batch of tasks to be carried
  out, thus avoiding individual processing of data sets. The way this is done is by specifying a batch file name as an
  argument to the <command>GDMS</command> command. The batch file contains the commands that will be run by the <command>GDMS</command>.
