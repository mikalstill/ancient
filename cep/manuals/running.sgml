<sect1><title>Running the <command>GDMS</command> with the GUI</title>
<para>
  The <command>GDMS</command> can be invoked in a number of ways. The first is to invoke the
  Graphical User Interface by typing ./gdms at the command line. The application is 
  loaded and can be used intuitively, like most other GUI based applications.
  For further information on specific functionality, see the quick reference guide.

<sect1><title>Running the <command>GDMS</command> with arguments</title>
<para>
  The <command>GDMS</command> increases its flexibility by allowing the use of 
  command line arguments. For example, a file name can be specified as an argument, 
  this avoids the necessity to open the file through the user interface upon entering the 
  application. The GUI is also loaded and can be used in the normal manner,
  the only difference being that data sets provided as arguments are already loaded.

<sect1><title>Batch Processing</title>
<para>
The <command>GDMS</command> also allows batch processing. This enables a batch of tasks to 
be scripted, thus avoiding individual processing of data sets. This is done is by
specifying a batch file name as an argument to <command>GDMS</command>. The batch file 
contains the commands that will be run by the <command>GDMS</command>.
