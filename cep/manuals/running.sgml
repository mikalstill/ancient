<sect1><title>Running the <command>GDMS</command> with the command line</title>
<para>
  The <command>GDMS</command> accepts command line arguments further increasing its flexibility. For example, a file name
  can be specified as an argument, avoiding having to open the file through the user interface once it has been invoked.

<sect1><title>Batch Processing</title>
<para>
As the title suggests, the <command>GDMS</command> allows batch processing. This enables a batch of tasks to be carried
out, thus avoiding individual processing of data sets. The way this is done is by specifying a batch file name as an
argument to the <command>GDMS</command> command.
