<para>
<command>GDMS</command> needs to be able to store information in temporary files to operate correctly. The only form
of information currently stored in temporary files, relates to the PNG graphs which are used in the user interface. This is
done to avoid the graphs having to be regenerated each time they are drawn. This technique also serves to avoid 
having images cached in memory, which could result in a large amount of memory being used for data that is not 
frequenclty accessed.
</para>

<para>
The <command>GDMS</command> determines when the files in the temporary graph cache are out of date. When this occurs, 
the graphs are regenerated as required.

<sect1><title>Location of temporary files</title>
<para>
Temporary files are stored by default in <emphasis>/tmp</emphasis>.
</para>

<execute><cmd>todo</cmd><input>Make this configurable</input></execute>

<para>
The files have randomly generated names which match the regular expression <emphasis>cep.*$</emphasis>. Examples of
valid temporary filenames are:
</para>

<programlisting>
cep.5tgSBw
cep.7v2DRn
cep.AxSGaC
cep.d4j1at
cep.dinwwj
cep.eu4OqI
cep.HDxyXc
cep.I6U6DO
cep.k2Wweg
cep.pDpvqC
cep.qcRKds
cep.sBiOhb
cep.VqHGbW
cep.YoTRdk
cep.zbOzJ3
</programlisting>

<para>
These files can amount to a non-trivial amount of space on disk. The example files totalled 808 kilobytes.

<sect1><title>Cleanup of temporary files</title>
<para>
The <command>GDMS</command> will automatically cleanup temporary files as required. In reality, this means that temporary
files from previous executions are deleted when the<command>GDMS</command> is run. Note that only the GUI implementation
cleans the <emphasis>/tmp</emphasis> directory. The <command>GDMS web</command> does not perform this operation as it
does not create it's temporary files in this manner. For further information refer to the <command>GDMS web</command> 
documentaiton.
</para>

<execute><cmd>todo</cmd><input>Multiple copies at once?</input></execute>

<para>
One draw back of this approach to temporary file clean up, is that it is not possible to have more than one instance
of the <command>GDMS</command> ruunning at one time, as the newest version of the program will clean up the cache of
the previous version's caches. Even though each instance of the program will regenerate their cache as required, this 
would be counter productive.
