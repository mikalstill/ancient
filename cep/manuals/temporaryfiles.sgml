<para>
<command>GDMS</command> needs to be able to store information in temporary files to operate correctly. The only form 
of information currently stored in temporary files is the PNG graphs, which are used in the user interface. This is 
done so that the graphs do not have to be regenerated every time they are drawn, and to avoid having to cache the 
images in memory, which could result in a large amount of memory being used to infrequently used data.
</para>

<para>
<command>GDMS</command> will determine when the files in the temporary graph cache are out of date automatically, 
and when this is the case will regenerate the graph as required.

<sect1><title>Location of temporary files</title>
<para>
Temporary files are stored by default in <emphasis>/tmp</emphasis>.
</para>

<execute><cmd>todo</cmd><input>Make this configurable</input></execute>

<para>
The files have randomly generated names which match the regular expression <emphasis>cep.*$</emphasis>. Examples of 
valid temporary filenames are:
</para>

<programlisting>
cep.5tgSBw
cep.7v2DRn
cep.AxSGaC
cep.d4j1at
cep.dinwwj
cep.eu4OqI
cep.HDxyXc
cep.I6U6DO
cep.k2Wweg
cep.pDpvqC
cep.qcRKds
cep.sBiOhb
cep.VqHGbW
cep.YoTRdk
cep.zbOzJ3
</programlisting>

<para>
These files can take a fair bit of disc space. The example files above took a total of 808 kilobytes.

<sect1><title>Cleanup of temporary files</title>
<para>
<command>GDMS</command> will automatically cleanup temporary files as required. In reality, this means that temporary 
files from previous runs are deleted when the<command>GDMS</command> starts up. Note that only the GUI implementation 
cleans the <emphasis>/tmp</emphasis> directory, <command>GDMS web</command> does not perform this operation
  <footnote><para>This is because <command>GDMS web</command> does not create it's temporary files in this manner. 
  Refer to the <command>GDMS web</command> documentation for further detail on this.</para></footnote>.
</para>

<execute><cmd>todo</cmd><input>Multiple copies at once?</input></execute>

<para>
One side effect of this cleanup methodology is that you cannot have multiple copies of <command>GDMS</command> 
running at once, as the newest version will clean up the previous version's caches. Then again, the other instances 
will regenerate their caches as required...
