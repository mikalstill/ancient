    <sect1><title>Aim</title> 
        <para> The aim of this project is to develop a computer software package to assist the University of Canberra survey Laboratory and other  
        relevant institutions with the analysis of their GPS, VLBI and SLR data relating to tectonic movement. Such an analysis involves  
        using mathematical techniques to model the data itself, as well as any anomalies that may occur, such as white noise and random walk,  
		  in both the time and frequency domains. Once the data has been transformed it will be displayed in a graphical format, thereby allowing the user  
		  to gain an accurate understanding of what the data represents.</para>

    <sect1><title>Relevance</title> 
        <para> 
            The analysis of GPS, VLBI and SLR data is required by many areas of natural science such as 
            geology and meteorology. Consequently, the efficient and precise analysis of such data sets  
            is crucial. This, in turn, will allow far greater accuracy in modeling and understanding many natural 
            phenomena including:- 
            <itemizedlist> 
                <listitem><para>The ability to correctly assess and understand continental drift.</para></listitem> 
                 
                <listitem><para>The ability to pin point stress lines within a given land mass, which often leads to the discovery of mineral 
                    deposits.</para></listitem> 
                 
                <listitem><para>A clearer, more precise picture of rising sea levels, which are widely believed to be a consequence of global 
                    warming.</para></listitem>

                    floods and droughts, which may, in turn, give us the ability to accurately predict them. </para></listitem> 
                 
                <listitem><para>There are a number of errors and measurement accuracy issues to consider during the processing of these data sets.   
                    In addition, some data sets are more susceptible to certain types of error, such as white noise, than others. By allowing 
                    the accurate modeling of such data sets and their errors, the suitability of each individual data set  
                    for some types of analysis can be more readily assessed.</para></listitem> 
                 
                <listitem><para>Although the effects of white noise can be seen from a time series of reasonable length (about 3-5 years), to  
                    accurately see the effects of random walk, at least 6 years of continuous time series data is required. Consequently, the  
                    ability to process large data sets (at least 10 years) will be critical in determining the effects of random walk.</para></listitem>

        <para> 
            In order to achieve the stated aims of the Tectonic Information Translation System ('the System') the following development methodology 
            will be adopted and implemented.

            <para> 
                During this design phase extensive research will be carried out in order to gain a better understanding of the mathematics involved 
                in the translation of tectonic data sets. This includes weighted least squares approximations, Fourier transforms, windowing functions, 
                and the interpolation of data sets. Such research will also serve to enhance the knowledge of the team with respect to the purpose and 
                relevance of such data analysis. In addition, at this stage, any potential customers will be identified and consulted to determine the 
                desired functionality of the System. Once this is carried out, an analysis of all customer viewpoints will be undertaken in order to 
                establish the functional and/or non-functional requirements of the system.

                    This stage is for the purpose of research and requirements collection only. Whilst a conceptual design for the System 
                    will be produced, it will not be implemented at this time.

            <para> 
                Once all requirements of the System have been specified a prototype will be developed. It is proposed that this prototype be produced using the 
                MATLAB mathematics package. The prototype itself will incorporate all basic functionality determined in Stage 1. Once the prototype has been 
                produced it will be used to validate and verify the customer requirements. In addition, this prototype may also be employed at a later stage to 
                verify that the System's output is correct.  
                 
                The completion of this stage is considered to be the minimum requirement to achieve a pass level in the Computer Engineering Project course.

                In the system development stage the conceptual design produced in Stage 1 will be implemented. It is anticipated that the 
                system will be developed using the C++ programming language and be capable of execution on all Unix (i.e. both System V and 
                BSD) style platforms. In addition, the system shall be as modular, scalable and multi-threaded as possible in order for

                In this phase the System will be thoroughly tested in accordance with a rigorous testing framework to ensure that

                be utilised to aid this process. In addition, an independent audit of all source code and a performance evaluation

    <sect1><title>Minimum Resource Requirements</title> 
 
        <para> 
            The minimum requirement for the System during the prototyping stage is 24-hour 7-day access to 1 Linux machine with MATLAB installed on it. 
            Although much of the prototyping code can be written in a Windows MATLAB environment, as the System itself will be produced for a Unix  
            based platform it would be preferable to maintain consistency in Operating Systems ('OS') for the duration of the project.  
        </para> 
 
	    <para> 
            In order to complete the project the minimum hardware requirements are considered to be a high end Machine. Essential attributes for an Intel 
            based machine are; 
            <itemizedlist> 
                <listitem><para>a CPU running at approximately 1.5 GHz.</para></listitem> 
                <listitem><para>at least 512 Mb of RAM.</para></listitem> 
                <listitem><para>a Unix based operating system.</para></listitem> 
            </itemizedlist> 
            If a non-Intel based machine is to be used then performance should be comparable with this system. It should be noted, however, that if 
            restricted to the minimum requirements, the desired response time of the system (approximately 60 seconds to process the data and produce a 
            result) may not be achievable. 
        </para> 
         
        <para> 
            Desirable hardware requirements would be a high end, multi-processor machine with in excess of 1 Gb RAM 
        </para> 
        <para> 
            Group members will also require 24-hour 7-day access to the target machine. All members of the group will also require any necessary privileges 
            to said machine to enable the development of the System. 
        </para> 
     
        <para> 
            For maximum performance, the target machine needs to be known, preferable in the early stages of the project. Writing the code for the system 
            with a single processor machine in mind and then running it on a multiprocessor machine and vice versa will not maximize the efficiency of the System, and may, in fact detrimentally impact on performance.
