<title>Documentation Process</title>

<para>
The group decided early in the project to automate the documentation process as
much as possible. A decision was made to use Docbook, providing a layout
consistent with many publications currently available. To further ease the
documentation process, various tools were used including docbooktools and
autodocbook.

This process enabled more focus to be placed on completing source code,
debugging, and integrating the final product to assist in ensuring the
completion of the project on time.
