Working as part of a team will always attract various challenges. This team was no different. In project situations such as
this, invariably, different team members will have varying degrees of knowledge and commitment. The level of commitment here
may come from different areas of motivation, whether it be interest or grade related. The GDMS team had several members
pursuing Honours as part of the engineering degrees. This means extensions to their work on the project, and desire for high grades.

When embarking on this project, it is safe to say that the full extent of the system was not entirely clear to everyone. In some cases
this was attributable to the aforementioned knowledge issues. In most case, however, there exists the opportunity to divide the project
up into components which suit every individual skills. In fact, this is arguably one of the more important skills a team must develop,
and develop early. Failing to do so will most certainly result in delays and unequal work distribution. Having said this, one must of
course consider that the aim with a project such as this is still to learn and develop in a chosen field.

The GDMS team dealt with the work division issue early in the project. Some member had MATLAB experience, so they were able to lead the
way in the development of the prototype. While this was taking place, research was being carried out to facilitate important decisions
for the final implementation. This included researching currently applications that claimed to do similar things, mathematical libraries
such as Fast Fourier Transforms, user interface options etc. Carrying out this research allowed work on the final implementation to be
run in parallel with the prototype.

For various reason, members of a team will and will not always get on all of the time. All of the GDMS members had other commitments at
University, at work, and with families. Each of these situations contributed pressure on individuals, in turn the group and ultimately
the project. There is also of course the issue of personalities. Different members of the team had different levels of experience, and
more often than not, different opinions. From time to time, these differences in opinions became a significant stumbling block. Whether
it was related to the way the system to be built, the way in which objects and classes interacted, coding style etc. People often feel
passionately about the way they have been taught, or the way they've been doing things for a period of time. Combine this with external
pressures, project pressures, and criky, SHE's GONNA BLOW. The GDMS team however, realising that progress was stunted in these
situations negotiated, compromised and moved on. To the best of my knowledge are all HAPPY LITTLE VEGIMITES.
