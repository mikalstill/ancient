Group Dynamics

Working as part of a team will always attract various challenges. This team was no different. 
In project situations such as this, invariably, different team members will have varying degrees of knowledge and commitment. 
The level of commitment here may come from different areas of motivation, whether it be interest or grade related. 
The GDMS team had several members pursuing Honors as part of the engineering degrees. 
This means extensions to their work on the project, and assurance of high grades.

When embarking on this project, it is safe to say that the full extent of the system was not entirely clear to
everyone. In some cases this was attributable to the aforementioned knowledge issues. In most case, however,
there exists the opportunity to divide the project up into components which suit every one. In fact, this
is arguable on of the more important skills a team must develop, and develop early. Failing to do so will most
certainly result in delays. Having said this, one must of course consider that the aim with a project such
as this is still to learn and develop in a chosen field.

The GDMS team dealt with the work division issue early in the project. Some member had MATLAB experience, so they were
able to lead the way in the development of the prototype. While this was taking place, research was being carried out to
facilitate important decisions for the final implementation. This included researching current applications
that claimed to do similar things, mathematical libraries such as Fast Fourier Transforms, user interface options etc.
Carrying out this research allowed work on the final implementation to be run in parallel with the prototype.

For various reason, members of a team will and will not always get on all of the time. All of the GDMS members had
other commitments both at University, at work, and with families. Each of these situations contributed
pressure on individuals, in turn the group and ultimately the project. There is also of course the issue of personalities. 
Different members of the team had different levels of experience, and more often than not, different opinions.

The differences in opinions was often an issue, as there were on going design and implementation issues being considered.
Whether is was related to the way the system to be built, the way in which objects and classes interacted, 
coding style etc. People often feel passionately about the way they have been taught, or the way they've been doing things
for a period of time. Combine this with external pressures, project pressures, and criky, she's gonna blow.
