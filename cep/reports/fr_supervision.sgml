Supervision

This project was initiated and supervised by Associate Professor Peter Morgan of the University of Canberra. Along with associates at various other universities, including MIT, Peter developed the specifications for GDMS. GDMS was categorized as research project, given that its aim was to assist in tectonic research.

Throughout the project, Peter provided assistance and guidance in the area of mathematics. This was not simply because the functions were complex, however, also due to the fact that Peter had specific algorithms in mind for many of the mathematical functions. The guidance also included among other things, the group being provided with file format information, and to some extent, the look and feel of the final product.

Given that the features of GDMS were not all explicitly laid out initially, there were issues with 'feature creep' in this project. This can be in part, attributed to a misunderstanding of exactly what would be involved in terms of functionality. Although broad functionality was defined, it was often found that in the process of implementing a given functionally, other required operations would be discovered. This was not only the case with the mathematical functionality, but also general class design.

This was made difficult at times due to the inability of the group to consistently gain immediate access to Peter. This occurred during those periods of time when he was carrying out other commitments overseas.
