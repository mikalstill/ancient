<title>Why FFT template class?</title>

<para>
A considerable amount of time was spend researching the FFTW (Fastest Fourier
Transform in the West) library written in C. The library is considered by many sources to be the most
correct, efficient, and probably the most widely used. Tests were carried out with the library  to
ensure it could be well integrated with GDMS.

During this testing process, another FFT library was found. This was a simple template class written
in C++. Testing was carried out with this class and it was decided that it would be more easily
integrated with GDMS, suiting the system's paradigm. During closer inspection and testing of the
template class, it was discovered that that is did have limitations and required some modifications.
The necessary changes were made and it was integrated. Although it is quite likely that FFTW has
greater levels of efficiency and flexibility, the template class offered a more consistent solution
for GDMS.

The group did intend to employ the use of FFTW is time allowed in order to surpass the restrictions of
the template class, however this was not to be the case.
