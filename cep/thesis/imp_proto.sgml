      The MATLAB prototype was the minimum requirement of the project. It was developed not only to carry out all of the essential
      mathematical functionality thus providing a working model, but to also act as a test bed for the final
      product. Most of the features implemented in C++ were tested in this way to ensure correct and
      consistent results. Limited time was spent on the prototype user interface so that it could be completed early enough in the
      project for group to be able turn to the full implementation in C++.

    <para>
       Prototyping can be an effective technique for identifying requirements in projects. We were able to use prototyping to prove our
       algorithms and also determine subtle functionalities that were required. One such example was recognising the needs for a generic
       data structure to handle various types that would be used in the mathematical functionality. This lead to the design of the Matrix
       class.

       The prototype was originally intended to be a product comparable to TSVIEW, with additional functionality,
       such as interpolation, windowing and frequency domain analysis.
       Once the the mathematical functionality of the prototype was complete, work began on a user interface (UI).
       Not long into the UI development, it was decided that it would not be of any benefit and that our attention should
       be focused on the main implementation of the application. The <command>m-files</command> from the Matlab prototype have been included
       on the CD accompanying this thesis.

    <para>
      The prototype provided a useful method of testing design ideas and algorithms
      before the implementation of the C++ code base. This allowed us to generate
      an initial rough idea for the projects design. Matlab however was a lot more 
      powerful than C++ when implementing the maths functions and some major design
      issues were missed.
