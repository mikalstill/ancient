      The MATLAB prototype was the minimum requirement of the project. It was developed not only to carry out all of the essential
      mathematical functionality thus providing a working model, but to also act as a test bed for final
      product functionality. Most of the features implemented in C++ were tested in this way to ensure correct and
      consistent results. Limited time was spent on the prototype user interface so that it could be completed early enough in the
      project for group to be able turn to the full implementation in C++.

       Prototyping can be an effective technique for identifying requirements in projects. We were able to use prototyping to prove our
       algrorithms and also determine subtle functionalities that were required. One such example was recognising the needs for a generaic
       data structure to handle various types that would be used in the mathematical functionality. This lead to the design of the Matrix
       class.

       The prototype was originally intended to be a product comparable to TSVIEW, however with addtional functionality,
       such as intrerpolation, windowing and frequency domain analysis.
       Once the the essesntial mathematical functionality in the prototype was complete, work began on a user interface.
       Not long into the UI development, it was decided that it would not be of any benifit and that our attention should
       be focused on the main implementaton of the application. The <command>m-files</command> from the Matlab prototype have been included
       on the CD acompanying this thesis.
