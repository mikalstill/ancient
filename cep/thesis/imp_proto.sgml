      The MATLAB prototype was the minimum requirement of the project. It was to carry out all of the essential
      mathematical functionality providing not only a working model, however also acting as a test bed for final
      product functionality. Most of the features implemented in C++ were tested in this way to ensure correct and
      consistent results. Limited time was spent on dressing the prototype as it was completed early enough in the
      project for group to be able turn to the full implementation in C++.

	IDEAS:::

       Prototyping can be an effective technique for identifying requirements in projects and this was no different in
       this case.

       The prototype was originally intended to be a product comparable to TSVIEW, however with addtional functionality,
       such as intrerpolation, windowing and frequency domain analysis.

       Once the the essesntial mathematical functionality in the prototype was complete, work began on a user interface.
       Not long into the UI development, it was decided that it would not be of any benifit and that our attention should
       be focused on the main implementaton of the application.

	Research also - TSView etc..
