This thesis discusses the theory and implementation of the <command>GDMS</command>, a software time series analysis tool box.
The year long project carried out by the authors, involved first prototyping a system in MATLAB, before implementing a full
version in ANSI ISO C++. A brief background on the past and current state of play in the area of time series analysis, giving
an indication of where the <command>GDMS</command> fits in. The thesis is divided into four main chapters. The first provides
a comprehensive look at the theory behind all process employed in the system. These include time domain and frequency domain
analysis, along with interpolation, windowing and of course the user interface. For the time domain analysis, these sections
 further divide, into areas such as linear least squares regression, weighting matrices and random walk. We then move to
 interpolation where discussion include linear interpolation, divided differences and cubic splines. The next logical step in
 the process takes us through windowing in its various forms, such as Hamming, Hanning, Chebychev and more. The frequency
 domain analysis details the theory for fast Fourier transforms and power spectral density plots.  The second chapter
 discusses the implementation of the prototype and the full system. In addition, issues which arose are examined here, along with discussions on how the
algorithms and the system as a whole can be improved. The final chapter concludes the project by looking back on the project
in terms of both its measure of success, and what we, the project team have taken away from the process.
