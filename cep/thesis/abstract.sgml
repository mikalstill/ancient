This thesis discusses the theory and implementation of the Geodetic Data Modelling System (<command>GDMS</command>), a software 
time series analysis application designed specifically for the analysis of Global Positioning Satellite (GPS), Very Long Baseline
Interferometry (VLBI) and Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) data. The year long project carried out by the authors, involved first 
prototyping a system in MATLAB, before implementing a full version in ANSI ISO C++. This thesis starts with a brief discussion on 
the history of time series analysis, and an introduction to the <command>GDMS</command>. It is then divided into five main chapters,
the first providing a comprehensive look at the theory behind all process employed in the system. These include time domain and 
frequency domain analysis, along with interpolation, windowing and the user interface. The second chapter
discusses design methodology,  the implementation of the prototype and of the <command>GDMS</command> itself. In addition, issues 
which arose are examined, along with suggestions for future enhancements that could be made to this system. The third chapter 
discusses the testing methodology, which is an integral part of any systems software design and the fifth chapter discusses the
documentation process. The final chapter reflects on the project as a whole in terms of meeting the project team's objectives 
expanding their body of knowledge.
