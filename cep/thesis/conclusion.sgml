<para>
  The GDMS packages offers a suite of time series analysis tools intended for the processing of data from various sources.
  The package was designed and implemented to be as flexible and as platform independent as possible given the time constraints
  under which the group working. We aimed to provide a package which would enhance on other currently availabl analysis
  tools. This involved providing time domain anlysis, frequency domain analysis and of course along with those, windowing and interpolation functionality.
  The loose object oriented design provides GDMS with a good deal  in the way of extensibiility. The extensive documentation
  will provide both users and developers in the future with an understanind of exactly how the system was constructed facilitating
  changes that may be desired.

<sect2><title>Did we succeed? - heading left for proofing only</title>
<para>
  The measure of the success of a project is contributed to by a number of factors. Perhaps the first and foremost concern
  in a software application is whether or not it actually works. This is of courase the most obvious measure of success to a user using the applicaiton.
  Having made this point, another one of significance is whether or not the application achieves was it was intended to achieve.
  In the case of GDMS, we started with a broad reuirements description. Based on these requirements, a project proposal was written. TODO: attach?
  This proposal outlined our intentions for the GDMS package.
</para>

<para>
  Throughout the course of the project some requirements were deemed unnecessary, however, overall, the
  requirements of the system grew compared to what we expected, in terms of fundamental requirements of the system.
  In many case, this were functionality deemed essential inorder to provide a system that was considered <emphasis>useful</emphasis>.
  In some case, these features were the finer detail of the broader requirements which we did not conconsider.
  As the dealine drew near, we needed to assess in orderof priority, which fucntionality was essentail and which wasn't.
  This was largely a role that Associciate Professor Peter Morgan played, he being the key stakeholder in GDMS.

<para>
  Having finally implemented a working system, with functionality such that the system was considered <emphasis>useful</emphasis>,
  we succeeded. A critical point here, is that this system from the very begining, was alsways to be an evolving
  one. Future project teams are expected to further enhance the functionality we have provided. Therefore, in terms of
  enahncing features of already available packages, we believe again, that we have succeeded. We have set up a
  platform upon which others can build, whilst providing something now. This is not to say that
  this is the definitive application for time series analysis, as that is clearly not the case. In fact, we do not
  consider this in itself, to be achievable in the time with which we had to complete this application. Time series analyis
  is a growing field of its own, and it would not be wise to expect to fill this area in a short finite session.
  We have hopwever, succeeded in providing a package which enhances on some functionality of other applications, and
  can be further enhanced in the future.

<sect2><title>What did we learn? - heading left for proofing only </title>
<para>
  A number of valuable lessons have been learnt from the GDMS development process, not all of which relate directly
  to application development. That which we consider to be the most critical lesson here, is planning. As previously mentioned,
   the orininal requirements were broad and did not cover many of the finer details required. It was during our initial requirements
   definition process, that we should have sought to discover as much as possible about exactly what was involved
   with various features in the braod specification. Our mathematical body of knowledge before the project began, was
   considered at leats enough to proceed, yet perhaps not quite enough to foresee these finer specification details.
