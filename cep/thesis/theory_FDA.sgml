  Fourier transforms enable us to view the frequency representation of data that exists in the time domain. In visual terms, the
  result is frequency on the horizontal axis with amplitude on the vertical. From such a graph, we can see details of what is happening in
  the data at particular frequencies. This provides for opportunities such as the removal of erroneous frequencies in the given data set
  and noise reduction. Once the desired actions have been carried out in the frequency domain, an inverse transform can be applied to
  return the data to the time domain.

  Another use of Fourier Transforms are to produce Power Spectral Density (PSD) plots.

  The concepts of frequency domain analysis should commence with the Fourier transform. Any waveform can be constructed purely from sine
  and cosine waves. An example of this is a pure square wave. It is constructed from the following:
  <equation>
    <title>Square Wave</title>
    <alt>x(n) = sin(f) + 1/3*sin(3f) + 1/5*(sin5f)</alt>
    <execute><cmd>img</cmd><args>fSquareWave.gif</args></execute>
  </equation>
</para>

<para>
	...for all odd harmonics. Where f is the fundamental frequency.
</para>

<para>
  It therefore stand to reason that any waveform can be broken down into to these sine and cosine components. The
  Fourier transform is such a tool to carry out this analysis. The Fourier transform effectively analysis a given input signal, by
  decomposing it into those sinusoids of different frequencies, that sum the original signal.

  The resulting function from a Fourier transform is function of frequency. This can be expressed in terms of frequency f, or angular
  frequency. The Fourier transform of a signal x(n) is:

  <equation>
    <title>Fourier Transform</title>
    <execute><cmd>img</cmd><args>fForward_fourier.gif</args></execute>
  </equation>
</para>

<para>
  We can also computer the inverse Fourier transform, returning us a function of time:

  <equation>
    <title>Inverse Fourier Transform</title>
    <alt>x(n) = 1/2pi * int( X( e^(jw) ) * e^(jwn) )dw - where w = 2pif</alt>
    <execute><cmd>img</cmd><args>fInverse_fourier.gif</args></execute>
  </equation>
</para>

<para>
  The above transforms, are not however, available for all sequences x(n). This is where the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) comes in. It
  restricts the sequence x(n) to the following conditions:
</para>

<para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> The N values x(0) ... x(N-1).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> Equidistant values around the unit circle.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
 The formula for the DFT is:

  <equation>
    <title>Forward Discrete Fourier Transform</title>
    <alt>X(k) = X(e^(j2pik/N)) = sum from n=0 ..N-1 ( x(n)*e^(-j2pikn/N) )</alt>
    <execute><cmd>img</cmd><args>fForward_discrete_fourier.gif</args></execute>
  </equation>

  and the inverse DFT:

  <equation>
    <title>Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform</title>
    <alt>x(n) = 1/N * sum from n-0..N-1(X(k)*e^(j2pikn/N))</alt>
    <execute><cmd>img</cmd><args>fInverse_discrete_fourier.gif</args></execute>
  </equation>

  The discrete frequency k above is given by f(k) = k*fs/N where fs is the sampling frequency of the signal.
</para>

<para>
  The problem with the DFT is that it is slow, with O(N^2). This brought about the Fast Fourier transform.
  The Fast Fourier transform takes into account that the DFT wastes a good deal of time with unnecessary multiplications. For example,
  there is no need to multiply something by zero, when the zero can be used outright. Given that multiplication is one of the slower
  instructions on computers, this is a time saver. Another area where the FFT screams efficiency, is that it takes into account the fact
  that value repeat in sinusoids. For example, every 90 degrees, the value 1 reappears on a sine or cosine changing only its sine. Therefore
  many results may determined by taking into account these factors. Through this increased efficiency, the FFT reduces the computation
  time to O(NlogN).

  The power spectrum is very useful in signal processing. It is the most common frequency measuremnt, allowing you to find how much energy
  exists at a given frequency. Derived from the power spectrum is the power spectral density (PSD) measurment. A PSD plot provides
  information on how much energy exists in a band of frequencies. This technique is particularly useful for measuring the noise content
  in a signal. A PSD plot is created by plotting the magnitude of the real and imaginary components of the FFT results.
