The first design requirement for the <command>GDMS</command> project, was that it be licensed under the GNU General Public
License. The reason for this is to allow access to the software by people who are not necessarily in a
position to use proprietary software. The <command>GDMS</command> package is complex and relies on a number of external
libraries for mathematical and graphical functionality. Similar proprietary libraries can be very
expensive.

Another issue influencing our design methodology was the the need to have a package which is
as platform independent as possible. This contributed significantly to the choice of programming
language. In using  ANSI ISO compliant C++, the <command>GDMS</command> package is intended to run on most Unix based
operating systems. It should also be noted that most modern windowing toolkits require C++.

The choice of user interface toolkit also maximized the cross platform capabilities of the application. 
<command>WxWindows</command> was therefore chosen as it has been specifically built to be easily ported, and currently 
runs on the following platforms:-

The next important design decision involves the methodologies used to design implement the <command>GDMS</command>
package. Given the complexity of the system, the Object Oriented approach was deemed the most
suitable. Using OO, the package lends itself well to future enhancements, maintenance and
extensibility. In fact, throughout the implementation process, changes in design were required to
suit the requirements of the growing system. These changes, although not always trivial, were facilitate by
the use of OO methodology.

  The following figure is a deployment diagram for the <command>GDMS</command>. Note that the Error handling has
  not been connected in the diagram in order to preserve clarity. With few exceptions, all of the 
  <command>GDMS</command> modules use the error handling sub-system. There are a number of reasons for this. The
  first is our desire to ensure that maximum possible stability of this system. This can only be achieved through
  efficient and appropriate error handling. For example, errors that are not fatal to the application will not cause
  termination, instead provide feedback on the error, before returning to a stable state. In addition, most operations use the 
  matrix class which often invokes dynamic memory allocation and it is vital to handel any errors that may arrise as a result for
  stablity reasons. Therefore, there needs to be constant tracking to ensure an error has not occurred.

  The next deployment digram is that of the error handling sub-system described above. In addition, each error is logged to file
  in order to facilitate debugging.

  <para>
    The modular design of the <command>GDMS</command> increases the potential for future improvements to the
    application, such as facilitating the addition of new mathematical functionality. The OO design
    can be built on by employing techniques such as inheritance. This technique has already been incorporated
    into the windowing sub-system of the <command>GDMS</command> and could used again in similar situations, where
    broad definitions can be defined for functionality, then specific classes can be derived from these higher
    level modules.
