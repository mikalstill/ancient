The first design requirement for the GDMS project, was that it be licensed un the GNU General Public
License. The reason for this is to allow access to the software by people who are not necessarily in a
position to use propriatry software. The GDMS package is complex and relies on a number of external
libraries for mathematical and graphical functionality. Similar pripriatry libraries can be very
expensive.

The second issue here, which is in fact related to the first, is the need to have a package which is
as platform independant as possible. This contributed significantly to the choice of programming
language. In using  ANSI ISO compliant C++, the GDMS package is intended to run on most Unix based
operating systems.

The next important design desicion involves the methodologies used to design implement the GDMS
package. Given the complexity of the system, the Object Oriented approach was deemed the most
suitable. Using OO, the package lends itself well to future enhancements, maintenance and
extensibility. In fact, throught the implementation process, changes in design were required to
suit the reuirements of the growing system. These changes, although not always trivial, were faciliated by
the use of OO methodology.
