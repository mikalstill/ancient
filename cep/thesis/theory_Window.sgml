  <para>Windowing is the technique used for breaking down an infinite signal into finite pieces. Since we are not able to record an 
  infinite signal, this process is essential. Truncation of the signal in this way, however, has side effects,
  primarily the introduction of ripples in the frequency domain. These ripples show up as high frequency noise and give</para>

  As previously stated, truncation of the signal in the time domain leads to unwanted ripples being produced in the frequency domain.
  The basic idea behind windowing the data prior to performing a Fourier transformation is that we can apply a weighting function
  to the sample in order to reduce the introduction of unwanted frequencies. This reduction is a trade off, and the cost is an
  increase in the width of the spectral peak and leakage of energy away from the true frequency to the side lobe skirts.
  This adversely effects the resolution with which we can observe the signal. We must strike a balance between spectral peak width
  and the degree of high frequency attenuation. Ideally we would like to have no skirts, but in practice the best we can do is try to
  control them. The available windowing algorithms vary in their ability to control this while trying to retain a fine spectral peak.
  The attributes of each algorithm can be summarised as follows:

  <listitem><para><emphasis>Hanning:</emphasis></para>
     <para>
       This algorithm provides good resolution of spectral peaks and acceptible rejection of side lobe skirts.
       It is a suitable choice for most applications. The Hanning window is a simple cosine offset by sufficient
       amount to make the minima be zero. The coefficients are calculated using the equation:
       <equation>
         <title>Hanning Window Coefficients</title>
         <execute><cmd>eqimg</cmd><args>hanning.bmp</args></execute>
       </equation>
     </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem><para><emphasis>Hamming</emphasis></para>
    <para>
      Hamming provides finer resolution of spectral peaks than Hanning windows, however, side lobe skirts are
      not controlled as well as with this method. The Hamming window is a slightly modified Hanning window,
      with the difference being that the DC bias is slightly different and the wave is slightly compressed.
      The coefficients are calculated as follows:
      <equation>
        <title>Hamming Window Coefficients</title>
        <execute><cmd>eqimg</cmd><args>hamming.bmp</args></execute>
      </equation>
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem><para><emphasis>Blackman</emphasis></para>
    <para>
      Blackman peak resolution is not as fine as that produced with the Hanning method. The advantage with
      the Blackman window is, however, that the response shape flares out less  at lower levels and rejection
      of side lobe skirts is better. Blackman window is composed of two cosine waves, causing the skirts to
      fall away faster than the previous two and resulting in a narrower peak. the equation is:
      <equation>
        <title>Blackman Window Coefficients</title>
        <execute><cmd>eqimg</cmd><args>blackman.bmp</args></execute>
      </equation>
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem><para><emphasis>Dolph-Chebyshev</emphasis></para>
    <para>
      Dolph-Chebyshev windows are very similar to those produced by Hamming, with improved high frequency attenuation. Where Hamming can
      provide around 50dB attenuation for frequencies above the sampling frequency, Dolph-Chebyshev can provide approximately 63dB
      attenuation for the same frequencies.This window is vastly different to the other windowing implementations. The coefficients are generated by
      calculating the inverse Fourier transform of the Chebyshev function evaluated at n equally spaced points on
      the unit circle. The Chebyshev function is defined as:
      <equation>
        <title>Chebyshev Function</title>

<sect2><title>Conclusion</title>
  <para>
    Windowing can be an effective tool in removing the undesirable effects of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Prudent use of a
    suitable algorithm removes the high frequencies introduced via aliasing when the the signal is truncated. Knowledge of the
    attributes and limitations of the individual windowing algorithms, and the judicious selection of the correct one, will assist
    the user in attaining optimal results from the application of the DFT.
