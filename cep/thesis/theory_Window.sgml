  Windowing can improve some incorrect results produced by pure DFT. Truncation of the signal in
  the time domain leads to unwanted ripples beung produced in the frequency domain. The basic idea
  behind windowing the data prior to performing conversion to the fourier is that we can apply a
  weighting function to the truncated signal in order to reduce the introduction of ripples in the
  fequency domain.
  The reduction in aliasing is a tradeoff, and the cost is an increase in the width of the spectral
  peak.Each separate windowing algorithm has different characteristics. According to Dakarta.com
  <!-- TODO remove this and put it in the refernces -->
  (http://www.daqarta.com/ww00wndo.htm) the characteristics are as follows

  Hanning:
    Good resolution of spectral peaks and good rejection of sidelobe leakage "skirts" at low levels
    for input signals that don't have an integer number of cycles in the N-points data set. A good
    choice for most uses. Hanning window is a simple cosine signal, offset so that the negaittive
    peaks are set to zero

  Hamming:
    Finer resolution of spectral peaks than Hanning, but poorer rejection of sidelobe skirts at low levels.
    w(i) = alpha - alpha*cos( 2*PI*i/(size-1) );   alpha=0.54

  Blackman:
    Peak resolution is not as fine as Hanning, but the response shape flares out less at lower levels
    and rejection of sidelobes is better
    w(i) = 0.42 - 0.5*cos( 2*PI*val ) + 0.08*cos(4*PI* i/(size-1));

  Dolph-Chebyshev:
    Very similar to hamming, with better high frequency attenuation. Where hamming results in a 50dB attenuation
    for frequencies above the sampling frequency, Dolph-Chebyshev provides 63dB attenuation for the same frequencies.
