  <para>Windowing is the breaking of an infinte signal into finite pieces. Since we are not able to record and infinite signal, and
  must analyse a finite sample, it is unavoidable that we perform this process. Truncation of the signal in this way has side effects,
  primarily the introduction of ripples in the frequency domain. These ripples show up as high frequency noise and give</para>

  As previously stated, truncation of the signal in the time domain leads to unwanted ripples being produced in the frequency domain.
  The basic idea behind windowing the data prior to performing a fourier tranformation is that we can apply a weighting function
  to the sample in order to reduce the introduction of unwanted frequencies. This reduction is a trade off, and the cost is an
  increase in the width of the spectral peak and leakage of energy away from the true frequency. Ideally we would like to have no
  skirts, but the reality is that the best we can do is try to control them. The available windowing algorithms vary in their ability to control this
  while trying to retain a fine specral peak. The attributes of each algoithm can be summarised as follows:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para><command>Hanning:</command></para>
     <para>
       This algorithm provides good resolution of spectral peaks and good rejection of side lobe skirts. It is a good choice fr most applications.
     </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem><para><command>Hamming</command></para>
    <para>
      Hamming proveds finer resolution of spectral peaks than Hanning, however side lobe skirts are not controlled as well as with Hanning.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem><para><command>Blackman</command></para>
    <para>
      Peak resolution is not as fine as Hanning, but the response shape flares out less at lower levels and rejection of side lobe skirts is better
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem><para><command>Dolph-Chebyshev</command></para>
    <para>
      Very similar to Hamming, but with with better high frequency attenuation. Where Hamming can give around 50dB attenuation
      for frequencies above the sampling frequency, Dolph-Chebyshev can provide approximately 63dB attenuation for the same frequencies.

  <para>
    Windowing can be an effective tool in removing the undesirable effects of the Discrete Fourier Transform. Prudent use of a
    suitable algorithm removes the high frequencies introduced via aliasing when the the signal is truncated. Knowledge of the
    attributes and limitations of the individual windowing algorithms, and the judicious selection of the correct one, will assist
    the user in attaining optimal results from the application of the DFT.
