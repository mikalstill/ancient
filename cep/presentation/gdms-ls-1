<li>Occilation of residuals problem

<BR><BR>

<li>The residuals are used to re-calulate a weighting matrix.
<li>Once the residuals become stable then the best regression model has been calculated
<li>I some cases, the residuals occilated and never became stable 
Domain

<li>Solution
  <ul>
  <li>Pre-multiply the residual matrix with the weighting matrix<br>
  <li>Remove any residual that has a value of zero<br>
  </ul.
