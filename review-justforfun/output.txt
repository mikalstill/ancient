   Just for fun, the story of an accidental revolutionary, is a
   jolly good read. It's conversation style, and lighthearted
   attitude make it accessible, and quite compelling. This book
   would be a good introduction into the motivations behind some
   people's contributions to open source for the uninitiated.

   Just for Fun is the story of Linus' life up to about 2001,
   told with the assistance of David Diamond (a journalist). The
   age of the book means that some of the book reads as a little
   out of date, for example Linus speaks extensively about the
   dot com bubble, which obviously hadn't burst at the time that
   Linus is writing.

   Rather conveniently, it appears that Linus has had a very easy
   to read life, although perhaps it is the literary style. The
   book is interesting, fun, and very very easy to read.
   Importantly to me, Linus doesn't pretend to have written the
   entire book himself, which is clearly not the case.
   Interspersed throughout the book are commentary segments
   written by David Diamond. Linus also seems to have his head
   screwed on the right way -- the irony of his position as a
   geek god by accident doesn't escape him. There are even
   passages in the book where you can see glimpses of Linus
   himself questioning his own fame.

   Just for Fun starts and ends with Linus attempting to explain
   his theory of the meaning of life, which is something along
   the lines of that all things go through three evolutionary
   stages: survival; social order; and the entertainment. For
   example, people started fighting initially to ensure survival,
   then they fought for social status, and now wars are waged as
   a form of entertainment on CNN and gaming consoles everywhere.
   Linus argues that a similar progression applies to software as
   well.

   The book discusses technical issues briefly, but is written in
   a way which is accessible for non-technical people. Linus and
   David spend a fair bit of time trying to explain open source,
   and what motivates people to contribute to open source. Just
   for fun would be a good book to hand to someone who wants to
   understand open source more, but isn't openly hostile to the
   concept initially.

   To me, as someone already comfortable with open source, the
   best bit of the book was starting to understand what motivated
   Linus to start writing Linux. I've been fielding lots of
   questions about that at work recently, and now I have some
   sort of answer that actually makes sense forming in the back
   of my brain. In summary, Linus was a geek who hid in his room
   a lot -- not just because of the fantastic weather Finnish
   winter weather, his rather traumatic sounding childhood had
   something to do with it as well -- who wanted to learn how to
   use his new 386 better. He therefore wrote a terminal
   emulator. Next, he wanted to be able to save files to disc in
   his terminal emulator, which ran on the bare 386 hardware, so
   he added a disc driver. After this, it dawned on Linus that he
   had started an operating system.

   Despite it's age, Just for fun is a jolly good read, and I
   would recommend it.
