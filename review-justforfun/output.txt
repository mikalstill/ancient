   Did you know that there is a maximum of ten words in a
   Google(TM) search, or that repeating a word results in
   different search results? What about the fact that some search
   types are antisocial, and wont work with other search types?
   How about the fact that the order of your keywords affects the
   results that are returned? Neither did I, and I use Google(TM)
   nearly every day.

   Just for Fun is the story of Linus' life, told with the
   assistance of a journalist. Rather conveniently, it appears
   that Linus has had a very easy to read life, although perhaps
   it is the literary style. The book is interesting, fun, and
   very easy to read.

   The book is filled with many little stories: - drinking
   fosters at a health farm (why fosters?)
