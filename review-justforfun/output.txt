   Just for Fun is the story of Linus' life, told with the
   assistance of a journalist. Rather conveniently, it appears
   that Linus has had a very easy to read life, although perhaps
   it is the literary style. The book is interesting, fun, and
   very easy to read.

   The book is filled with many little stories: - drinking
   fosters at a health farm (why fosters?)
