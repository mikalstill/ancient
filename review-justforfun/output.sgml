<emphasis>Did you know that there is a maximum of ten words in a <trademark>Google</trademark> search, or that repeating a word results in different search results? What about the fact that some search types are antisocial, and wont work with other search types? How about the fact that the order of your keywords affects the results that are returned?

<emphasis>Just for Fun</emphasis> is the story of Linus' life, told with the assistance of a journalist. Rather conveniently, it appears that Linus has had a very easy to read life, although perhaps it is the literary style. The book is interesting, fun, and very easy to read.
