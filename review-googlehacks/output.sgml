<para>
Did you know that there is a maximum of ten words in a Google search, or that repeating a word results in different search results? What about the fact that some search types are antisocial, and wont work with other search types? Neither did I, and I use Google nearly every day.

<para>
I should probably start this review by letting you know that <emphasis>Google Hacks</emphasis> is not a book aimed at developers. It lists 100 interesting things you can do with Google, in a quite accessible manner. I would be comfortable with handing this book to a school child who needed to know how to use Google effectively. Especially if they had used the Internet before and know what a browser, and a URL are.

<para>
Then again, this doesn't mean that <emphasis>Google Hacks</emphasis> is simplistic. It still describes how to alter URLs, how to search using the Google special syntaxes, and so forth.
