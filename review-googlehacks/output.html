>Did you know that there is a maximum of ten words in a <SPAN

CLASS="TRADEMARK"

></SPAN

CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN

CLASS="emphasis"

CLASS="TRADEMARK"

>&#8482; Hacks</I
></SPAN
> &mdash; on the contrary, there are regular examples in Perl of how to parse saved <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; output, and use the <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; API &mdash; it is more that these examples are presented as utilities to use as is, and are not the topic of discussion in their own right. I would be comfortable with handing this book to a school child who needed to know how to use <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; effectively. Especially if they had used the Internet before and know what a browser, and a URL are.</P
><P
>Then again, this doesn't mean that <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
><SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; Hacks</I
></SPAN
> is simplistic. It still describes how to alter URLs, how to search using the <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; special syntaxes, and so forth. <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
><SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; Hacks</I
></SPAN
> even describes topics such as how to search date ranges (you can specify any Julian date range to <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482;, although it must be an integer).</P
><P
>The <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; API is a quite useful part of the <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; offerings. The <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; API is offered by via a SOAP interface, which makes it relatively easy to access for most programmers. <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
><SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; Hacks</I
></SPAN
> describes how to reference the <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; API in a variety of programming languages, and then goes on to show a series of example applications written in Perl.</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
><SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; Hacks</I
></SPAN
> also has a fun side. There is a section describing <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; poetry, and <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; art. The basic process of <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; art is to post a message to a Usenet group (preferably one of the test groups) which contains keywords contrived in such a manner that a picture is displayed when a specific search is executed in <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; Groups. The colour of each pixel results from the automatic keyword hi-lighting which occurs in <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; Groups search results. Your picture is somewhat limited however, in that <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; searches only support ten keywords, and therefore you can only have ten colours in your picture. The resolution supported by the text interface is also somewhat limited.</P
><P
>Some of the hacks described in <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
><SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; Hacks</I
></SPAN
> are also quite non-hackish. For example, there is a whole section on how to build a useful website that Googlebot will find attractive to index. There is also discussion on possible formulations for the <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>PageRank</SPAN
>&#8482; algorithm, as well as how to maximize <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482;'s <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>PageRank</SPAN
>&#8482; for your site.</P
><P
>Because each hack is meant to stand on it's own in this <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"reference mode"</SPAN
> of use, there is a lot of repeated information. For example, many of the hacks describe how there is no access to a particular piece of functionality from the <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; API, and that screen scraping in an automated manner is a breach of the <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; terms of service. Similarly, the same prelude to setup the <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; API is repeated in many of the examples of the API's use. Having read <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
><SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; Hacks</I
></SPAN
> from cover to cover, this repetition was really starting to get on my nerves by the end of the book.</P
><P
>In conclusion, once you bear in mind that <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
><SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482; Hacks</I
></SPAN
> is not aimed at developers, its a good read. It also makes an excellent reference for those who regularly use <SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>Google</SPAN
>&#8482;, or are interested in learning more. The book is written in a manner which makes the vast majority of the content available to technical novices, whilst still discussing technical issues which really matter.</P
