What is this?
=============

A very very long time ago I published all my Open Source code as a subversion repository on http://www.stillhq.com. That website is dead now, but I found this code in an old backup. Its online because people still ask for access to some of it, but you should note its very old and sad.

For more details, email me at mikal@stillhq.com.
