Why not echo?
-------------

Note that we can't use the name <i>echo</i> for our service because of a couple of reasons: it is already defined in /etc/services; it is an internal service which <b>inetd</b> already offers using the normal port number; and we wanted to define a different port number for the service, without breaking things which might use the old /etc/services entry.
