This file describes the SQL dialect spoken by trivsql:

When the dialect is complete, trivsql will be capable of the following:

SELECT <DISTINCT> colnames FROM tablenames selector <ORDER BY colname>
  <GROUP BY colname> <HAVING colnames condition value>
INSERT INTO tablename <(colnames)> VALUES (vals)
UPDATE tablename SET colname = newval WHERE colname = someval
DELETE FROM tablename WHERE colname = someval

CREATE TABLE tablename (colname datatype, colname datatype, ...)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX indexname ON tablename (colnames)

ALTER TABLE tablename [ADD | DROP] COLUMN colname <coltype with add>

DROP INDEX tablename.indexname
DROP TABLE tablename
DROP DATABASE dbname

DELETE colnames FROM tablenames

where selector can be:
  NOTHING
  WHERE col condition val
  WHERE col condition val [AND | OR] selector
  WHERE (selector) [AND | OR] selector
  
  WHERE col <NOT> BETWEEN val1 AND val2

  WHERE table1.col1 = table2.col2
  [INNER | OUTER | RIGHT | LEFT] JOIN tablename on table1.val1 = table2.val2

and colnames can also be the following functions:
  COUNT(colname) -- the colname is ignored though
  AVG(colname)
  MAX(colname)
  MIN(colname)
  SUM(colname)
  
and columns and tables can be renamed using:
  name AS newname

Valid conditions: = <> > < >= <= BETWEEN LIKE

Syntax hints:
 - Column names cannot be wrapped in quotes
 - Table names cannot be wrapped in quotes
 - String values can be wrapped in quotes
 - Quote escapes don't currently work
