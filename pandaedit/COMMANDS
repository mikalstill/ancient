PandaEdit has a variety of different tools. All of these have behaviour which is at least loosely modelled on the Adobe Illustrator behaviour I love so much. This file describes the commands which have been implemented so far.

COMMON COMMANDS
---------------

Right click while hovering over an object to select that object. This will make the control points appear. Any new drawing commands will be appended to this newly selected object (if that makes sense for that tool).

Shift click on a control point to move that point.

LINE TOOL
---------

When I first started using Illustrator, it took me about an hour to work out how to draw a straight line -- a seemingly simple task. It turns out to be a special case of the bezier curve tool. PandaEdit avoids all of this by implementing a line drawing tool (called 'line' in the command list). The following behaviours are implemented:

 - click with left mouse button: draw a straight line from the previous point to here. If this is the first point, then simply turn on a single pixel.

 - draw with left mouse button: the same behaviour as above, but it results in the appearance of a curved "freehand" line being drawn.

 - click with left mouse button with control key down: end the current line drawing session. The line tool is still the selected tool.

 - select another tool: end the current line.
