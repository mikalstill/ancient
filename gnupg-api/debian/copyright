This is Debian/GNU Linux's prepackaged version of GNUPG, a free PGP
replacement. As you can see from the version number, the program may
have some bugs and some features may not work at all.

This package was put together by me, James Troup
<james@nocrew.org>, from the sources, which I obtained from
ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/pub/gcrypt/gnupg-0.9.10.tar.gz.  The changes were
minimal, namely:

- adding support for the Debian package maintenance scheme, by adding
  various debian/* files.
