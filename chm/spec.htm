<H1>Microsoft's HTML Help (.chm) format</H1>
<H2 id=preface>Preface</H2>
<P>This is documentation on the .chm format used by Microsoft HTML Help. This 
format has been reverse engineered in the past, but as far as I know this is the 
first freely available documentation on it. One Usenet message indicates that 
these .chm files are actually IStorage files documented in the Microsoft 
Platform SDK. However, I have not been able to locate such documentation. </P>
<H3>Note</H3>
<P>The word "section" is badly overloaded in this document. Sorry about 
that.</P>
<P>All numbers are in hexadecimal unless otherwise indicated in the text. Except 
in tabular listings, this will be indicated by $ or 0x as appropriate. All 
values within the file are Intel byte order (little endian) unless indicated 
otherwise. </P>
<H2 id=overview>The overall format of a .chm file</H2>
<P>The .chm file begins with a short ($38 byte) initial header. This is followed 
by the header section table, the offset to the content, and a number of bytes of 
information of unknown use. Collectively, this is the "header". </P>
<P>The header is followed by the header sections. There are two header sections. 
One header section is the file directory, the other contains the file length and 
some unknown data. Immediately following the header sections is the content. 
</P>
<H2 id=header>The Header</H2>
<P>The header starts with the initial header, which has the following format 
</P><PRE>0000: char[4]  'ITSF'
0004: DWORD    3 (Version number)
0008: DWORD    Total header length, including header section table and
               following data.
000C: DWORD    1 (unknown)
0010: DWORD    a timestamp.
0014: DWORD    Windows Language ID.  The two I've seen
               $0409 = LANG_ENGLISH/SUBLANG_ENGLISH_US
               $0407 = LANG_GERMAN/SUBLANG_GERMAN
0018: GUID     {7C01FD10-7BAA-11D0-9E0C-00A0-C922-E6EC}
0028: GUID     {7C01FD11-7BAA-11D0-9E0C-00A0-C922-E6EC}
</PRE>
<P>Note: a GUID is $10 bytes, arranged as 1 DWORD, 2 WORDs, and 8 BYTEs.</P>
<P>It is followed by the header section table, which is 2 entries, where each 
entry is $10 bytes long and has this format: </P><PRE>0000: QWORD    Offset of section from beginning of file
0008: QWORD    Length of section
</PRE>
<P>Following the header section table is 8 bytes of additional header data. In 
Version 2 files, this data is not there and the content section starts 
immediately after the directory. </P><PRE>0000: QWORD    Offset within file of content section 0
</PRE>
<H2 id=headersections>The Header Sections</H2>
<H3>Header Section 0</H3>
<P>This section contains the total size of the file, and not much else </P><PRE>0000: DWORD    $01FE (unknown)
0004: DWORD    0 (unknown)
0008: QWORD    File Size
0010: DWORD    0 (unknown)
0014: DWORD    0 (unknown)
</PRE>
<H3>Header Section 1: The Directory Listing</H3>
<P>The central part of the .chm file: A directory of the files and information 
it contains. </P>
<H4>Directory header</H4>
<P>The directory starts with a header; its format is as follows: </P><PRE>0000: char[4]  'ITSP'
0004: DWORD    Version number 1
0008: DWORD    Length of the directory header
000C: DWORD    $0a (unknown)
0010: DWORD    $1000    Directory chunk size
0014: DWORD    "Density" of quickref section, usually 2.
0018: DWORD    Depth of the index tree
               1 there is no index, 2 if there is one level of PMGI
	       chunks.
001C: DWORD    Chunk number of root index chunk, -1 if there is none
               (though at least one file has 0 despite there being no
	       index chunk, probably a bug.) 
0020: DWORD    Chunk number of first PMGL (listing) chunk
0024: DWORD    Chunk number of last PMGL (listing) chunk
0028: DWORD    -1 (unknown)
002C: DWORD    Number of directory chunks (total)
0030: DWORD    Windows language ID
0034: GUID     {5D02926A-212E-11D0-9DF9-00A0C922E6EC}
0044: DWORD    $54 (This is the length again)
0048: DWORD    -1 (unknown)
004C: DWORD    -1 (unknown)
0050: DWORD    -1 (unknown)
</PRE>
<H4>The Listing Chunks</H4>
<P>The header is directly followed by the directory chunks. There are two types 
of directory chunks -- index chunks, and listing chunks. The index chunk will be 
omitted if there is only one listing chunk. A listing chunk has the following 
format: </P><PRE>0000: char[4]  'PMGL'
0004: DWORD    Length of free space and/or quickref area at end of
               directory chunk 
0008: DWORD    Always 0. 
000C: DWORD    Chunk number of previous listing chunk when reading
               directory in sequence (-1 if this is the first listing chunk)
0010: DWORD    Chunk number of next listing chunk when reading
               directory in sequence (-1 if this is the last listing chunk)
0014: Directory listing entries (to quickref area)  Sorted by
      filename; the sort is case-insensitive.
</PRE>
<P>The quickref area is written backwards from the end of the chunk. One 
quickref entry exists for every n entries in the file, where n is calculated as 
1 + (1 &lt;&lt; quickref density). So for density = 2, n = 5. </P><PRE>Chunklen-0002: WORD     Number of entries in the chunk
Chunklen-0004: WORD     Offset of entry n from entry 0
Chunklen-0008: WORD     Offset of entry 2n from entry 0
Chunklen-000C: WORD     Offset of entry 3n from entry 0
...
</PRE>
<P>The format of a directory listing entry is as follows </P><PRE>      BYTE: length of name
      BYTEs: name  (UTF-8 encoded)
      ENCINT: content section
      ENCINT: offset
      ENCINT: length
</PRE>
<P>The offset is from the beginning of the content section the file is in, after 
the section has been decompressed (if appropriate). The length also refers to 
length of the file in the section after decompression. </P>
<P>There are two kinds of file represented in the directory: user data and 
format related files. The files which are format-related have names which begin 
with '::', the user data files have names which begin with "/". </P>
<H4>The Index Chunk</H4>
<P>An index chunk has the following format </P><PRE>0000: char[4]  'PMGI'
0004: DWORD    Length of quickref/free area at end of directory chunk
0008: Directory index entries (to quickref/free area)
</PRE>
<P>The quickref area in an PMGI is the same as in an PMGL </P>
<P>The format of a directory index entry is as follows </P><PRE>      BYTE: length of name
      BYTEs: name  (UTF-8 encoded)
      ENCINT: directory listing chunk which starts with name
</PRE>
<P>When higher-level indexes exist (when the depth of the index tree is 3 or 
higher), presumably the upper-level indexes will contain the numbers of 
lower-level index chunks rather than listing chunks </P>
<H4>Encoded Integers</H4>
<P>An ENCINT is a variable-length integer. The high bit of each byte indicates 
"continued to the next byte". Bytes are stored most significant to least 
significant. So, for example, $EA $15 is (((0xEA&amp;0x7F)&lt;&lt;7)|0x15) = 
0x3515. </P>
<H2 id=content>The Content</H2>
<P>The content typically immediately follows the header sections, and is at the 
location indicated by the DWORD following the header section table. All content 
section 0 locations in the directory are relative to that point. The other 
content sections are stored WITHIN content section 0. </P>
<H3>The Namelist file</H3>
<P>There exists in content section 0 and in the directory a file called 
"::DataSpace/NameList". This file contains the names of all the content 
sections. The format is as follows: </P><PRE>0000: WORD     Length of file, in words
0002: WORD     Number of entries in file

Each entry:
0000: WORD     Length of name in words, excluding terminating null
0002: WORD     Double-byte characters
xxxx: WORD     0
</PRE>
<P>Yes, the names have a length word AND are null terminated; sort of a 
belt-and-suspenders approach. The coding system is likely UTF-16 (little 
endian). </P>
<P>The section names seen so far are </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Uncompressed 
  <LI>MSCompressed </LI></UL>
<P>"Uncompressed" is self-explanatory. The section "MSCompressed" is compressed 
with Microsoft's LZX algorithm. </P>
<H3>The Section Data</H3>
<P>For each section other than 0, there exists a file called 
'::DataSpace/Storage/&lt;Section Name&gt;/Content'. This file contains the 
compressed data for the section. So, conceptually, getting a file from a nonzero 
section is a multi-step process. First you must get the content file from 
section 0. Then you decompress (if appropriate) the section. Then you get the 
desired file from your decompressed section. </P>
<H3>Other section format-related files</H3>
<P>There are several other files associated with the sections </P>
<UL>
  <LI>::DataSpace/Storage/&lt;SectionName&gt;/ControlData 
  <P>This file contains $20 bytes of information on the compression. The 
  information is partially known: </P><PRE>0000: DWORD    6 (unknown)
0004: ASCII    'LZXC'  Compression type identifier
0008: DWORD    2 (Possibly numeric code for LZX)
000C: DWORD    The Huffman reset interval in $8000-byte blocks
0010: DWORD    The window size in $8000-byte blocks
0014: DWORD    unknown  (sometimes 2, sometimes 1, sometimes 0)
0018: DWORD    0 (unknown)
001C: DWORD    0 (unknown)
</PRE>
  <LI>::DataSpace/Storage/&lt;SectionName&gt;/SpanInfo 
  <P>This file contains a quadword containing the uncompressed length of the 
  section. </P>
  <LI>::DataSpace/Storage/&lt;SectionName&gt;/Transform/List 
  <P>It appears this file was intended to contain a list of GUIDs belonging to 
  methods of decompressing (or otherwise transforming) the section. However, it 
  actually contains only half of the string representation of a GUID, apparently 
  because it was sized for characters but contains wide characters. </P></LI></UL>
<H2 id=compression>Appendix: The Compression</H2>
<P>The compressed sections are compressed using LZX, a compression method 
Microsoft also uses for its cabinet files. To ensure this, check the second 
DWORD of compression info in the ControlData file for the section — it should be 
'LZXC'. To decompress, first read the file 
"::DataSpace/Storage/&lt;SectionName&gt;/Transform/{7FC28940-9D31-11D0-9B27-00A0C91E9C7C}/InstanceData/ResetTable". 
This reset table has the following format </P><PRE>0000: DWORD    2     unknown (possibly a version number)
0004: DWORD    Number of entries in reset table
0008: DWORD    8     unknown
000C: DWORD    $28   Length of table header (area before table entries)
0010: QWORD    Uncompressed Length
0018: QWORD    Compressed Length
0020: QWORD    0x8000 block size for locations below
0028: QWORD    0 (zeroth entry of table)
0030: QWORD    location in compressed data of 1st block boundary in
               uncompressed data

Repeat to end of file
</PRE>
<P>Now you can finally obtain the section (from its Content file). The window 
size for the LZX compression is 16 (decimal) on all the files seen so far. This 
is specified by the DWORD at $10 in the ControlData file (but note that DWORD 
gives the window size in 0x8000-byte blocks, not the LZX code for the window 
size) </P>
<P>There is one change from LZX as defined by Microsoft: After each Huffman 
reset interval (defined in the ControlData file, but in practice equal to the 
window size) of compressed data is processed, the decoder state is partially 
reset: that is, the Huffman length tables are cleared and the one-bit 
preprocessing header is reread. The LZ window is not cleared. </P>
<P>The rule that the input bit-stream is to be re-aligned to a 16-bit boundary 
after $8000 output characters have been processed IS in effect, despite this LZX 
not being part of a CAB file. The reset table tells you when this was done, 
though there seems to be no need for that during decompression; you can just 
keep track of the number of output characters. Furthermore, while this does not 
appear to be documented in the LZX format, the compressed stream is padded to an 
$8000 (decimal) byte boundary. </P>
