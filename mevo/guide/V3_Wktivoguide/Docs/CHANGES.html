<p>

<h2>New Operation</h2>

<p>
There are now four phases:

<p>

<ol type="1"><p>
<li> <em>./fetch_data All 0 6</em> fetches web data</li>
<p>
<li> <em>./genre_search All 0 6</em> find genres for unknown programs</li>
<p>
<li> <em>./add_data All 0 6</em> adds extra information to data files</li>
<p>
<li> <em>./make_slice All 0 6</em> builds a slice</li>
</ol>
For all 4 phases, the two numbers are the start and end day relative
to today, i.e. 0 is today, 6 is 6 days away. Negative numbers are
allowed.

<p>
For the first 3 phases, the `All' word means all the channels in the
<em>websources</em> file, or you can name a specific channel in the
<em>websources</em> file. The <em>websources</em> file can hold more station
names than you use to create a slice. This is to cater for people
who make dozens of different slices, some of which contain common
stations.

<p>
Only the <em>./fetch_data</em> and <em>./make_slice</em> phases are
mandatory. The <em>./genre_search</em> and <em>./add_data</em> phases
are optional.

<p>

<h2>Configuration Files</h2>

<p>
The <em>.guiderc</em> file now allows you to specify the name of every
run-time file, so can you do this:

<p>

<blockquote>Configdir = ./Files

<p>
Numbers = ./Files/numbers 

<p>
Stations = ./Files/stations 

<p>
Episodes = ./Files/episodes 

<p>
Websources = ./Files/websources
</blockquote>

<p>

<h3>Fetching</h3>

<p>
The Ebroadcast and Foxtel fetchers have been rewritten. They are now
much more robust and can also extract episode titles.

<p>
If you have multiple web sources of data, you can fetch from one source
and then fetch from another source if the first one fails. You would
make two <em>websources</em> files, e.g <em>websources</em> and <em>websources-backup</em>.
You would make two config files, e.g <em>.guiderc</em> and <em>.guiderc-backup</em>,
and they would be identical except that the first would say:

<p>

<blockquote>Websources = ./Files/websources
</blockquote>
and the second one would say

<p>

<blockquote>Websources = ./Files/websources-backup
</blockquote>
Now, you could write a shell script loop that does this:

<p>

<pre>
./fetch_data ABC 0 6
if [ "$?" = "1" ]
then echo Error fetching ABC, trying backup web source 
     ./fetch_data -c .guiderc-backup ABC 0 6 
fi

</pre>

<p>
Or, you could just fetch all the web data and try all the backups

<p>

<pre>
./fetch_data All 0 6
if [ "$?" = "1" ]
then echo Error fetching some web data, trying our backups 
     ./fetch_data -c .guiderc-backup All 0 6 
fi

</pre>

<p>
The first <em>fetch_data</em> won't make intermediate files unless
there was some web data. The second <em>fetch_data</em> will only fetch
if there is no web data for a channel, and it won't rebuild the intermediate
files unless they don't exist.

<p>

<h2>The Programs Database</h2>

<p>
The <em>programs</em> database can now be kept either in a file (<em>Files/programs</em>)
or in a MySQL database. If you want to keep it as a file, make this
symbolic link in the TiVo/ directory:

<p>

<blockquote>% cd TiVo; ln -s ProgramDbFile.pm ProgramDb.pm
</blockquote>
If you want to keep the database in MySQL, make this symbolic link:

<p>

<blockquote>% cd TiVo; ln -s ProgramDbSQL.pm ProgramDb.pm
</blockquote>
The SQL database schema is documented in <em>ProgramDbSQL.pm</em>.

<p>

<h3>Add Data</h3>

<p>
If many slices are being made which contain common data, it is pointless
to rescan the <em>programs</em> database and the movie ratings database
several times for the same program. There is now the optional phase
called <em>add_data</em>, which takes the intermediate files in the
<em>Data</em> directory, adds in the extra information and stores the
new intermediate files in a new directory defined in the configuration
file:

<p>

<blockquote>Extradir = ./Data2
</blockquote>
This phase loads the programs database, the trimtitles file, the Movie
ratings file and now the Movie directors file.

<p>
The file format for the Movie ratings file and the Movie directors
file is now different from the IMDB file format, because the IMDB
format slows down the parsing. In <em>Misc/</em> there are two converters
that convert the IMDB format into the new format. Once the conversion
is done, you need to gzip the converted files and store them in Files/:

<p>

<blockquote>Files/directors.tivo.gz and Files/ratings.tivo.gz
</blockquote>

<p>

<h2>Make Slices</h2>

<p>
<em>make_slice</em> builds a slice for All the stations in the <em>stations</em>
file, or just one station, for the list of days given. This is the
only phase which will update the <em>episodes</em> file and the <em>numbers</em>
file, and so this is the only phase which has the -n option.

<p>
The output file name can be specified with two %ds in the configuration
file like this:

<p>

<blockquote>Slicefile = ./AC02601_%d-%d.slice 

<p>
Textfile = ./AC02601_%d-%d.txt
</blockquote>
The first %d becomes the TiVo daynumber for the start day. The second
%d becomes the TiVo daynumber for the end day. If you don't use %ds
in your config file, then your output filename will be the same for
all slices.

<p>
<em>make_slice</em> will first try to get intermediate data from the
<em>Data2/</em> directory (i.e from the output of add_data). But if
that fails, it will get it from the <em>Data/</em> directory, and it
will do the adding of genres, stars, directors etc. on the fly.

<p>

<h2>Timezone Handling</h2>

<p>
The <em>stations</em> and <em>websources</em> files have been changed
to properly handle timezone shifting between transmitter and receiver.

<p>
A typical websources entry now looks like this:

<p>

<pre>
Channel Fetcher Timezone          URL information
========================================================
ARNA    Foxtel  Australia/Sydney  ARN # Arena

</pre>

<p>
The timezone is specified as it appears in most Linux or Unix boxes
in <em>/usr/share/zoneinfo</em>. This is the timezone of the transmitting
station.

<p>
Typical <em>stations</em> entries now look like this:

<p>

<pre>
Channel Station-id       Timezone
================================================================
ARNA  Station/1/7000100  Australia/Melbourne  # Arena
ARNA  Station/1/7000100  DoNotShift           # Arena

</pre>

<p>
The timezone is the same format as the <em>websources</em> file. Here
it specifies where the receiving TiVo is. In this case it is in Melbourne,
so there will be an appropriate timezone shift from Sydney to Melbourne;
usually 0 hours except that they change to/from daylight saving at
different times so it could be +1 and it could be -1 on some days.

<p>
Sometimes the provider of a channel does its own time delay, so that
a program appears at the same local time in all timezones. If this
is the case, set the timezone to the magic word ``DoNotShift''.
This will preserve the original times for all programs on that channel,
i.e. no timezone shifting will be done. You would use the second entry
as shown above.

<p>

<h3>Setup For Multiple Slices</h3>

<p>
You need a config file for each slice which names the output slice
name and the stations file for that slice. You need a stations file
for each slice. It is a good idea to have a common <em>trimtitles</em>,
<em>programs</em> file, <em>episodes</em> file and <em>websources</em> file.
For my setup here in Australia, I keep everything in the <em>Files/</em>
directory:

<p>

<pre> 
directors.tivo.gz       rc-TA07001              stations-NT00806
episodes                rc-TA07004              stations-QL04001
genretypes              rc-TA07005              stations-QL04002
numbers                 rc-TA07006              stations-QL04003
ratings.tivo.gz         rc-VI03001              stations-QL04004
rc-AC02601              rc-VI03002              stations-QL04005
rc-AC02602              rc-VI03003              stations-QL04006
rc-AC02603              rc-VI03004              stations-SA05001

rc-NS02003              rc-VI03007              stations-SA05005
rc-NS02004              rc-WA06001              stations-SA05006
rc-NS02005              rc-WA06003              stations-TA07001
rc-NS02006              rc-WA06004              stations-TA07004
rc-NS02007              rc-WA06005              stations-TA07005
rc-NT00801              rc-WA06006              stations-TA07006
rc-NT00803              rrc-backup              stations-VI03001
rc-NT00804              stations-AC02601        stations-VI03002
rc-NT00805              stations-AC02602        stations-VI03003
rc-NT00806              stations-AC02603        stations-VI03004
rc-QL04001              stations-NS02001        stations-VI03005
rc-QL04002              stations-NS02002        stations-VI03006
rc-QL04003              stations-NS02003        stations-VI03007
rc-QL04004              stations-NS02004        stations-WA06001
rc-QL04005              stations-NS02005        stations-WA06003
rc-QL04006              stations-NS02006        stations-WA06004
rc-SA05001              stations-NS02007        stations-WA06005
rc-SA05003              stations-NT00801        stations-WA06006
rc-SA05004              stations-NT00803        trimtitles
rc-SA05005              stations-NT00804        websources
rc-SA05006              stations-NT00805        websources-backup

</pre>

<p>
Note that the <em>websources</em> file specifies all the channels I
fetch, but <em>websources-backup</em> only has some of the channels,
and lists the backup web sources.

<p>
For the <em>fetch_data</em> I use <em>-c Files/rc-AC02601 All 0 6</em>
to fetch from the primary <em>websources</em> and <em>-c Files/rrc-backup</em>
to fetch from the backup <em>websources</em>.

<p>
Then I <em>./genre_search -c Files/rc-AC02601 All 0 6</em>, but it
doesn't matter which config file I use here as long as it points to
all the channels, i.e to <em>websources</em>.

<p>
I run <em>./add_data -c Files/rc-AC02601 All 0 6</em> to build the
<em>Data2/</em> files. Finally I do:

<p>

<pre>
for i in Files/rc-* 
do ./make_slice -c $i All 0 6
done

</pre>

<p>
to build the slices.
