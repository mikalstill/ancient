In the intermediate file format, each program record consists of these lines.
Each line starts with a keyword then a colon then exactly one space character
and then the actual value. Some lines are optional and are shown with asterisks
below. For the comma-separated lists, there is no whitespace on either side
of the commas.

A single file should only contain data for a specific daynum. The two
fetchers in version 3 of Wktivoguide will only put out data for a specific
daynum. If there is data for another day, then it will be ignored.

The data in a single file ____MUST____ be in ascending time order!!!

The intermediate file format can now contain Latin-x characters, as these
will be remapped and/or stripped by SliceBuilder.pm.
