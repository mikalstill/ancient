<p>

<center>Version 3.1, January 2004. (c) Warren Toomey, BSD license.<br />
</center>

<p>
This program fetches TV program data from web sources, and converts
this data into a slice file which can be loaded into a TiVo. At present,
it can only obtain Australian TV program data, but it can be modified
to fetch and parse data from other sources.

<p>
The program can output program data in the binary slice format which
the TiVo requires. Alternatively, it can output the data in a textual
form which can then be converted into a slice file using tridge's
writeguide program.

<p>
It's a good idea to read this README file from start to end, especially
the bits about the files that get regenerated during each run. Things
may not work if you don't set them up correctly.

<p>

<h2>RECENT CHANGES</h2>

<p>
<b>3.1:</b> First release of new version.

<p>

<h2>CHANGES FROM VERSION 2</h2>

<p>
These are now documented in a <a href="CHANGES.html">separate file</a>.

<p>

<h2>OVERVIEW OF OPERATION</h2>

<p>
Wktivoguide is a set of four programs, a bunch of configuration files
and directories that hold intermediate files. Each program represents
one of the four phases of operation.

<p>

<center><img src="phases.gif" alt="phases.gif" /></center>

<p>

<h3>Phase One - Fetching Web Data</h3>

<p>
The first phase is to fetch and parse the web data for the slice(s)
that you want to build. At present there are web fetchers for Ebroadcast
and Foxtel in Australia. Other fetchers would be reasonably easy to
write, and the existing fetchers could be used as a template. The
fetch phase reads a list of TV channels from a configuration file
called <em>websources</em>, and writes a set of intermediate data files
into the <em>Data</em> directory. These files contain only the information
that is required to build the slices. The fetch phase also stores
the raw web pages fetched into the <em>Webfiles</em> directory; if you
re-run the fetch phase and there are web pages in the <em>Webfiles</em>
directory, no web connections will occur and the files in the <em>Data</em>
directory will be recreated from the information in the <em>Webfiles</em>
directory.

<p>

<h3>Phase Two - Searching for Unknown Genres</h3>

<p>
One problem with the data found by the web search is that it often
does not give us an idea of the genre of the programs found (Movie,
Comedy, Drama etc.). To overcome this, <em>Wktivoguide</em> keeps a
database of programs and their genres, which is called the <em>programs</em>
file or the <em>programs</em> database. The second, optional, phase
is to read through the files in the <em>Data</em> directory, compare
the programs there with those stored in the <em>programs</em> file,
and determine which programs don't have a known genre.

<p>
For every unknown program, this phase sends a query out to an Australian
Yahoo website to see if the program's genre can be determined. The
result (known or not found) is stored back into the <em>programs</em>
file. The <em>trimtitles</em> file is also consulted: this is used to
trim common things from the front of a program's title (e.g. Special:,
Movie of the Week:, Drama: etc.)

<p>

<h3>Phase Three - Adding Genre and Other Data</h3>

<p>
With the basic program data in the <em>Data</em> directory, this optional
phase can add extra data to these files. It will add in the genre
of the program, the star rating and director if the program is a movie,
and it will use heuristics to determine an episode name. The results
are stored into a second directory called <em>Data2</em>.

<p>

<h3>Phase Four - Making the Slice(s)</h3>

<p>
In the last phase, the program data that we have gathered and augmented
will be converted into slice format. If the <em>Data2</em> directory
exists, this phase will use the data files from this directory. If
only the <em>Data</em> directory exists, then this phase will load the
data from there, and perform Phase Three on the fly. The result is
the final slice file which can be loaded into the TiVo.

<p>

<h2>INSTALLATION</h2>

<p>
The <em>Wktivoguide</em> program comes as a front-end Bourne shell script
called <em>doit</em>. This calls the four Perl scripts: <em>fetch_data</em>,
<em>genre_search</em>, <em>add_data</em> and <em>make_slice</em>. These
make use of a number of back-end Perl modules in the TiVo/ directory.
You will need a Unix machine with Perl 5 installed and you will also
need to install the <b>HTTP::Lite</b> and <b>CGI::Enurl</b> Perl
modules.

<p>
The software is designed to be unpacked and run in the directory where
you unpacked it. Later on, I'll describe what to do if you want to
generate multiple slices in the same directory.

<p>

<h2>GETTING HTTP::Lite</h2>

<p>
Get HTTP::Lite from any CPAN mirror. I found it at: <a href="ftp://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/perl/CPAN/modules/by-category/15_World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI/HTTP"><tt>ftp://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/perl/CPAN/modules/by-category/15_World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI/HTTP</tt></a>.
At the time of writing, the latest version is HTTP-Lite-2.1.4.tar.gz.
Download the latest tarball somewhere. Then do:

<p>

<blockquote>% tar vxzf HTTP-Lite-2.1.4.tar.gz 

<p>
% cd HTTP-Lite-2.1.4 

<p>
% perl Makefile.PL 

<p>
% make 

<p>
% su root 

<p>
# make install
</blockquote>
I hope that works. I normally use the Perl CPAN auto-fetching support
to install new Perl modules.

<p>

<h2>GETTING CGI::Enurl</h2>

<p>
If you plan to use the <em>genre_search</em> phase, or if you plan
to run the command <em>./doit search</em>, then you will also need to
install the CGI::Enurl Perl module. It is installed in the same way
as HTTP::Lite. I found it at <a href="ftp://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/perl/CPAN/modules/by-category/15_World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI/CGI"><tt>ftp://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/perl/CPAN/modules/by-category/15_World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI/CGI</tt></a>.

<p>

<h2>TOP-LEVEL CONFIGURATION FILE</h2>

<p>
<em>Wktivoguide</em> has a top-level configuration file, and a number
of other files which store a database of information between runs
of the program. The top-level configuration file is called .<em>guiderc</em>
and should be placed in the directory where you unpacked <em>Wktivoguide</em>.
There is an example <em>.guiderc</em> configuration file in the distribution.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> The scripts <em>doit</em>, <em>fetch_data, genre_search</em>,
<em>add_data</em> and <em>make_slice</em> all have a <em>-c</em> option
that allows you to specify configuration files other than <em>.guiderc</em>.
This is useful if you want to generate multiple different slice files
using the software.

<p>
The .<em>guiderc</em> configuration file controls the basic behaviour
of the program, and also defines where the run-time files are and
where to store the intermediate guide data. Lines beginning with a
hash are ignored; so are blank lines. Configuration lines look like
variable = value. Here is a brief description of all variables; for
more information see the .<em>guiderc</em> file that came with the distribution.

<p>

<center>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>Variable</b></td><td align="center"><b>Used For</b></td><td align="center"><b>Default Value</b></td></tr><tr><td>
<tr><td align="center">Configdir</td><td align="center">Where the other config files live</td><td align="center">./Files</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Datadir</td><td align="center">Where intermediate guide data is stored by fetch_data</td><td align="center">./Data</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Extradir</td><td align="center">Where intermediate guide data is stored by add_data</td><td align="center">./Data2</td></tr>

<tr><td align="center">Debugfile</td><td align="center">File that holds debugging output</td><td align="center">No default</td></tr></table>
</center>

<p>
The <em>Configdir</em> variable gives the directory name where the run-time
files are stored. You <b>will need</b> to create this directory
before you can run the program, and also populate it with the run-time
files. Example run-time files are given in the Files/ directory. We
will look at these files later.

<p>
Phase one of <em>Wktivoguide</em> (i.e. <em>fetch_data)</em> downloads
web data and distills it into an intermediate guide format. The data
in the intermediate format is stored in the directory named by the
<em>Datadir</em> variable. You <b>will need</b> to create this directory
before you can run the program. You should also make the directory
named by the <em>Webdir</em> variable.

<p>
If you choose to run phase three of <em>Wktivoguide</em> (i.e. <em>add_data</em>),
<em></em>then you <b>will need</b> to create the directory named by
the <em>Extradir</em> variable.

<p>
<em>Wktivoguide</em> will automatically clean out all of these three
directories by removing files older than 14 days.

<p>
Details for all the other configuration parameters can be found in
the .<em>guiderc</em> file that came with the distribution.

<p>

<h2>RUN-TIME FILES</h2>

<p>
<em>Wktivoguide</em> uses the following run-time files which are kept
in the <em>Configdir</em> directory. Some example files are provided
in the Files/ directory. Warning: You <b><em>will</em></b> need to
change most of these files.

<p>

<h3>genretypes</h3>

<p>
This file lists the program categories (also known as genres) which
the TiVo knows. Do not edit this file; treat it as read-only.

<p>

<h3>stations</h3>

<p>
This file holds the names of the stations known to <em>Wktivoguide</em>,
the TiVo internal station-id for the station, and the timezone where
this station will be received. The 3 columns are tab-separated. Lines
starting with hashes are ignored. I am using:

<p>

<pre>
# List of stations and the internal TiVo id
TVQ46           Station/1/7111010       Australia/Brisbane
ABC-QLD         Station/1/7111002       Australia/Brisbane
BTQ52           Station/1/7111007       Australia/Brisbane
QTQ58           Station/1/7111009       Australia/Brisbane
SBS-QLD         Station/1/7111028       Australia/Brisbane
#TenGC          Station/1/7111055       Australia/Brisbane
#Prime          Station/1/7111064       Australia/Brisbane
#NBN            Station/1/7111067       DoNotShift
#AV             Station/1/7111099       Australia/Brisbane
NoNag           Station/1/7111099       Australia/Brisbane

</pre>

<p>
The TiVo internal station-ids can be found using the method described
on <a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/twiki/bin/view/Hintsortips/HowToFindSourceID">this web page</a>.

<p>
The timezone is specified as it appears in most Linux or Unix boxes
in <em>/usr/share/zoneinfo</em>.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Sometimes the provider of a channel does its own time
delay, so that a program appears at the same local time in all timezones,
e.g. a cable channel. If this is the case, set the timezone to the
magic word ``DoNotShift''. This will preserve the original times
for all programs on that channel, i.e. no timezone shifting will be
done. You would use the entry for NBN as shown above.

<p>

<h3>websources</h3>

<p>
This file holds the list of stations again, what mechanism to use
to get them, the timezone where the transmitter operates, and some
portion of a URL which is used to fetch the data. At present, the
only mechanisms for downloading data are the `Ebroadcast' mechanism
and the `Foxtel' mechanism. As before, the columns are tab-separated
and lines beginning with hashes are ignored.

<p>
To find out the Ebroadcast URL portion for your channels, go to <a href="http://www.ebroadcast.com.au/tv"><tt>http://www.ebroadcast.com.au/tv</tt></a>,
select a location for today, and click on `View TV Schedule'. You
should see a table with a list of station names down the left-hand
side. Click on the ones you want, and grab the appropriate right-hand
portion of the new URL from the Location field at the top of your
browser.

<p>
Here is the file I use. Note that the NoNag channel must not be defined
in this file. Note also that there can be many more stations defined
in this file than in the <em>stations</em> file.

<p>

<pre>
# List of web sources for each station defined in the stations file.
# Columns are: station name, web source, timezone, and any
# specific URL information that we need to use to get the data.
#
HALL    Foxtel  Australia/Sydney        HAL     # Hallmark Channel
MOV1    Foxtel  Australia/Sydney        MV1     # Movie One
ABC-QLD Ebroadcast      Australia/Brisbane      2&amp;state=Brisbane&amp;fta=1
SBS-QLD Ebroadcast      Australia/Brisbane      SBS&amp;state=Brisbane&amp;fta=1
BTQ52   Ebroadcast      Australia/Brisbane      7&amp;state=Brisbane&amp;fta=1
QTQ58   Ebroadcast      Australia/Brisbane      9&amp;state=Brisbane&amp;fta=1
TVQ46   Ebroadcast      Australia/Brisbane      10&amp;state=Brisbane&amp;fta=1

</pre>

<p>

<h3>numbers</h3>

<p>
This file holds numbers which have to be unique for certain records
in the final TiVo slice. This file is only used by the <em>make_slice</em>
phase. I'm using:

<p>

<pre>
# List of incremental numbers
Series:  100053808
Program: 140171812
StationDay: 300005812
Slice: 394

</pre>

<p>
You could probably reset them to 100000000, 200000000, 300000000 and
a small number like 50. Note that once you use a number, you can't
reuse it. I had to pick numbers I knew were not used by tridge's SOFCOM.slices,
but if you have a factory fresh TiVo, then I guess you could use any
numbers.

<p>

<h3>programs</h3>

<p>
This file holds the known program names and a list of genre identifiers
separated by commas. The two columns are tab-separated. You should
use at least one broad category name, but you can use any of the names
given in the <em>genretypes</em> file. We now have a communal programs
file available at <a href="ftp://minnie.tuhs.org/tivo/guidefiles/programs">ftp://minnie.tuhs.org/tivo/guidefiles/programs</a>.
E-mail me if you want to help us to maintain this file and fix the
Unknown genre problem!

<p>
Note on matching program names. For most titles, an exact match is
done between the web title and the title in the programs file. If
no matches are found, the web program is considered to be Unknown.
However, if the two letters <b>|P</b> are at the end of a title
in the programs file, then partial matches are permitted. For example,
assume that the <em>programs</em> file holds these lines:

<p>

<blockquote>About Us|P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Documentary,DocumentaryGroup

<p>
Absolutely Fabulous&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comedy,ComedyGroup
</blockquote>
and these raw titles arrive from the web data:

<p>

<blockquote>About Us: The Life of John Cleese

<p>
Absolutely Fabulous

<p>
Absolutely Fabulous on Stage
</blockquote>
The first program will be matched, and ``The Life of John Cleese''
will be used as the episode title. The second title will be matched,
but the third title will be treated as an Unknown program.

<p>

<h3>trimtitles</h3>

<p>
This file holds patterns which occur in program titles that are superfluous,
and can be trimmed from the titles. For example, channel Ten often
prepends the pattern `Movie: ' to its movie titles. By putting this
pattern in here, <em>Wktivoguide</em> will remove it from the title
when doing the conversion. Each line contains a genrelist which <em>Wktivoguide</em>
will use in case the remaining title is not found in the <em>programs</em>
file, and an optional word `Never' to indicate that the program is
never an episode of a series. You should not have to edit this file,
unless you see program titles that clearly could be trimmed.

<p>

<h3>episodes</h3>

<p>
This file holds the program names which are known to be episodic;
if a program name appears in here, then it must also appear in the
programs file. For programs which are named in this file, you can
ask the TiVo to record a `Season Pass'. <b>Warning:</b> Do not edit
this file, as <em>Wktivoguide</em> builds this file for you automatically.

<p>
Hint: It's a good idea to periodically backup all of these configuration
files; if they ever get lost you might be able to go back to a known
point in time.

<p>

<h3>SETTING THESE FILES UP FOR THE FIRST TIME</h3>

<p>
These are the files you should edit only once: <em>numbers</em>, <em>stations</em>,
<em>websources</em>. You should then download a new copy of the <em>programs</em>
file from <a href="ftp://minnie.tuhs.org/tivo/guidefiles/programs">ftp://minnie.tuhs.org/tivo/guidefiles/programs</a>.
Then you should <b>delete</b> the <em>episodes</em> file, as this
will be created for you. You can leave the other files (<em>genretypes</em>
and <em>trimtitles</em>) as they are.

<p>
Each phase will rewrite different files:

<p>

<ol type="1"><p>
<li> <em>fetch_data</em>: No files will be modified.</li>
<p>
<li> <em>genre_search</em>: The <em>programs</em> file is updated.</li>
<p>
<li> <em>add_data:</em> No files will be modified.</li>
<p>
<li> <em>make_slice:</em> The <em>numbers</em> and <em>episodes</em> files will
be updated.</li>
</ol>

<p>

<h2>RUNNING THE PROGRAM THE EASY WAY</h2>

<p>
Once you have configured your <em>.guiderc</em> and the <em>numbers</em>,
<em>stations</em> and <em>websources</em> files, you are ready to try
running the program. Ebroadcast updates their web site on Thursday
morning, so it is best to do the following on Thursday night, Fridays
or Saturdays, but you can run the program at any time.

<p>
Make sure the <em>Webdir, Datadir</em> and <em>Extradir</em> directories
that you have chosen exist. Then run the <em>doit</em> shell script
to fetch some guide data:

<p>

<blockquote>% ./doit fetch
</blockquote>
This should give some lines indicating that data is being retrieved,
and the result will be a collection of files in the <em>Datadir</em>
which holds the guide data in intermediate format. The <em>Webdir</em>
should also have the raw web files.

<p>
Once the fetch phase is successful, you can search Yahoo for new genres:

<p>

<blockquote>% ./doit search
</blockquote>
With that complete, you can augment your intermediate data:

<p>

<blockquote>% ./doit add
</blockquote>
Finally, you can create your slice:

<p>

<blockquote>% ./doit make
</blockquote>
The result is a new <em>output.slice</em> file which holds a week's
worth of data. You can also do <em>./doit both</em> to both fetch the
guide data from the web and produce the <em>output.slice</em> file (i.e.
phases one and four). You can also do <em>./doit both</em> to run all
four phases.

<p>

<h2>RUNNING THE PROGRAM THE HARD WAY</h2>

<p>
The <em>doit</em> script works out the list of days to fetch, and then
calls <em>fetch_data, genre_search, add_data</em> or <em>make_slice.</em>
You can call these Perl scripts by hand. To run <em>fetch_data</em>,
do:

<p>

<blockquote>% fetch_data [-c configfile] station start_day end_day
</blockquote>
Options are:

<p>

<blockquote><b>-c configfile</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the named configuration file instead
of <em>.guiderc</em>
</blockquote>
The station is the name of the station from column 1 of the websources
file. Alternatively, you can use the word `All', and the program will
operate on all the stations named in the websources file.

<p>
The start day and end day are day numbers relative to today, e.g 0
is today, 1 is tomorrow. You can specify negative as well as positive
day numbers.

<p>
You run <em>genre_search</em> and <em>add_data</em> in exactly the same
way as for <em>fetch_data.</em>

<p>
To run <em>make_slice</em>, you can do:

<p>

<blockquote>% make_slice [-n] [-c configfile] station start_day end_day
</blockquote>
Options are:

<p>

<blockquote><b>-c configfile</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the named configuration file instead
of <em>.guiderc</em>

<p>
<b>-n&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Don't rewrite the <em>numbers</em> file.
</blockquote>
The station option this time refers to a station from the <em>stations</em>
file, or the word `All' to mean all stations in the <em>stations</em>
file.

<p>
Typically you would run <em>fetch_data</em> to get the web data; then
you would do a <em>genre_search</em>; then you would edit the <em>programs</em>
file to hand-edit any Unknown entries; then you would do an <em>add_data</em>;
finally you would run <em>make_slice</em> to generate the slice file.
e.g.

<p>

<blockquote>% ./fetch_data All 0 6 

<p>
% ./genre_search All 0 6

<p>
% vi Files/programs

<p>
% ./add_data All 0 6

<p>
% ./make_slice All 0 6
</blockquote>
which is basically what the <em>doit</em> script does.

<p>

<h2>UPDATING THE PROGRAMS FILE</h2>

<p>
Although you can update this file by hand, it is probably best to
download the latest communal programs file, which is available at
<a href="ftp://minnie.tuhs.org/tivo/guidefiles/programs">ftp://minnie.tuhs.org/tivo/guidefiles/programs</a>.

<p>
However, if you have done a <em>fetch_data</em> and hopefully a <em>genre_search</em>,
you may still find some programs with no known genre in the <em>programs</em>
file. Use the genre categories in the <em>genretypes</em> file to replace
or improve the entries in this file. And if you see a program with
obvious episode names like these:

<p>

<blockquote>2002 FIFA WORLD CUP - FRANCE vs URUGUAY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown

<p>
2002 FIFA WORLD CUP - GERMANY vs REPUBLIC OF IRELAND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unknown

<p>

</blockquote>
then remove the episode name and replace the multiple lines with one
line ending in <b>|P</b>, for example:

<p>

<blockquote>2002 FIFA WORLD CUP|P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SportsGroup

<p>

<p>

problem.

<p>

<h2>STOPPING THE TIVO FROM NAGGING</h2>

<p>
Each week, the TiVo nags you about being nearly out of program data.
<em>Wktivoguide</em> can overcome the nag problem. It does so by generating
data for an unused channel for 7 days ahead of now. Thus, the TiVo
thinks it has 7 more days of guide data, and it won't nag you.

<p>
To make use of this feature, you need to create a channel on the TiVo
that you will <b>never use</b>. Just choose a channel number which
you can't receive, and create a TiVo station using that frequency.
Then in the TiVo setup, make it a channel that you don't receive.

<p>
Next, put an extra line in the <em>Files/stations</em> file which has
a station named `NoNag'. Put in the station-id which identifies this
channel in the TiVo. For an example, see the <em>stations</em> file
above.

<p>
Finally, choose an existing real channel whose data we will use to
fool the TiVo, and use it as the `NoNag' channel in your <em>.guiderc.</em>
Any real channel will do; I happen to use channel Ten.

<p>
Each week, <em>Wktivoguide</em> will re-use the Channel Ten data, but
set the date for 14 days in the future and create slice data for the
NoNag channel. Thus, the TiVo will be fooled into thinking that it
always has program guide data.

<p>

<h2>LOADING SLICE FILES</h2>

<p>
Once you have generated your weekly <em>output.slice,</em> you now need
to move the resulting slice file over to your TiVo. Consult your local
TiVo community to find out how to do this for your type of TiVo and
the version of its system.

<p>

<h2>MOVIE STAR RATINGS AND DIRECTORS</h2>

<p>
If you want to see slice entries with star ratings for movies, then
go to the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/interfaces">Alternate Interfaces</a>
section of the Internet Movie Database, scroll down to the Plain Text
Data Files section, and download the file called <em>ratings.list.gz</em>.
While you are there, also download the file <em>directors.list.gz</em>.

<p>
The format for these files is very awkward to parse, so <em>Wktivoguide</em>
keeps the data in these files in its own format. To convert from IMDB
format to <em>Wktivoguide</em> format, do the following:

<p>

<pre>
% Misc/cvt_ratings ratings.list.gz &#62; ratings.tivo
% Misc/cvt_directors directors.list.gz &#62; directors.tivo
% gzip -9 ratings.tivo directors.tivo
% mv ratings.tivo.gz directors.tivo.gz Files/

</pre>

<p>
The new files <em>ratings.tivo.gz</em> and <em>directors.tivo.gz</em>
should be moved into the <em>Configdir</em> directory (i.e. where <em>programs</em>
and <em>trimtitles</em> are kept). When you now make a slice, <em>Wktivoguide</em>
will read both files, and add movie star ratings and director information
to your slices where possible.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> The TiVo only has up to 4 stars instead of the usual
5, so <em>Wktivoguide</em> code does a remapping from 5 stars to 4 stars.
As a simple guide, here is what you should see:

<p>

<ul><p>
<li> 1 star means poor</li>
<p>
<li> 2 stars means fair</li>
<p>
<li> 3 stars means good</li>
<p>
<li> 4 stars means excellent</li>
</ul>
The TiVo has half-star increments, so a 3 1/2 star movie is very good
but not excellent.

<p>

<h2>BUGS AND OMISSIONS</h2>

<p>
Probably plenty. Let me know if you find any.

<p>
I do some conversion of Ebroadcast program ratings to what the TiVo
expects, but it could be further refined. I try to separate the list
of actors in a program from the program's description, but it is only
heuristic.
