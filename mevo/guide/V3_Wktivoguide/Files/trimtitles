# Words to trim from the titles of programs. An second column
# gives the genre, in case there isn't a specific match in the
# programs file. An optional third column indicates if this
# program is never an episode of a series.
#
# NOTE: Both the genre and the Never here can be overridden in
# the programs file. For example, if we have
#
#	Drama:	Drama,DramaGroup	Never		in this file
#	Blue Heelers	SoapOpera			in the programs file
#	Blue Heelers | 100034056 | 53			in the episodes file
#
# and this raw title appear:  DRAMA: BLUE HEELERS
#
# then the program will trim off the DRAMA: part and set the program to
# be Drama,DramaGroup but never an episode. But then the BLUE HEELERS part
# will match the line in the programs file, and this will cause the program
# to be part of the 100034056 series, and be the SoapOpera genre.
