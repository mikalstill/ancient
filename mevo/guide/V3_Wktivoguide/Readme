   Wktivoguide - Warren Toomey's Homegrown TiVo Slice Generator 

   Version 3.1, January 2004. (c) Warren Toomey, BSD license.

This program fetches TV program data from web sources, and converts
this data into a slice file which can be loaded into a TiVo. At
present, it can only obtain Australian TV program data, but it can
be modified to fetch and parse data from other sources.

See the full documentation in Docs/README.html and Docs/CHANGES.html.
