# Configuration file for Wktivoguide. This controls the basic behaviour of
# the program, and also defines where the other configuration files are
# and where to store the incoming data. Lines beginning with a hash are
# ignored; so are blank lines. Configuration lines look like variable = value

# The Configdir holds the main config files:
#	genrelist, which describes the genres that the TiVo knows
#	numbers, holding sequence numbers for slice files etc
#	stations, which names each station and its internal TiVo id
#	websources, which describes where to get data for each station
#	programs, which holds the title and genre of all known programs
#	episodes, describing episode numbers ofprograms having season passes
#	trimtitles, which allows you to trim parts of program titles
#
Configdir = ./Files

# If you have a need to keep these files in separate areas, then you can
# use the following config variables to name the location of specific files.
# However, I recommend that you stick with just the Configdir named above.
#
# Genretypes = some/file/name
# Programs = some/file/name
# Numbers = some/file/name
# Stations = some/file/name
# Episodes = some/file/name
# Trimtitles = some/file/name
# Websources = some/file/name


# The Datadir is where the guide data extracted from the Web sources
# is stored before the slice is created. The Extradir is where add_data
# stores the intermediate files which have had extra information added.
# This program will clean up old files in here periodically.
Datadir = ./Data
Extradir = ./Data2

# The Webdir is the directory where incoming web files are stored.
# This program will clean up old files in here periodically.
#
Webdir = ./Webfiles

# If you need to use a proxy, then define the hostname and port here
#Webproxy = iris.bond.edu.au:8080
#Webproxy = firewall.local.net:80

# If WebDelay is defined, then fetch_data and genre_search will wait
# this many seconds between web connections. It can help to minimise
# our overall load on a web server.
WebDelay = 3

# Attempt this many times to fetch from the web source before giving up.
# Optional, but if you define it, don't set it below 1!
#RepeatWebConnect = 4

# Set the NoNag variable to be the name of the channel whose data
# you want to use to give the NoNag channel data in the future.
# Choose any of your real channel names.
NoNag = TVQ46

# Do you want Wktivoguide to output data in slice format, ready for
# downloading into the TiVo, or do you want it to output data in text
# format, which can then be processed by tools like writeguide into
# slice format? The only values are slice or text. Default is slice.
#
Outputformat = slice
#Outputformat = text

# Depending on what output format you have chosen, the output from
# Wktivoguide will be stored in one of these files.
Slicefile = ./output.slice
Textfile = ./output.txt

# The following line defines a debugging file where debug output will
# appear. This is optional and off by default. It is only useful for
# the developers of this program
#Debugfile = ./debug.out
