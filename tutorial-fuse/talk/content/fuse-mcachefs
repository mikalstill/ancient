TITLE: mcachefs

<ul>
<li>The example I'm going to talk about during this tutorial is mcachefs
<li>A relatively simple caching filesystem based on FUSE
<li>You tell it:

<ul>
<li>what locally mounted directory is the target
<li>where to put cached copies of files from that target
<li>where to mount the cache filesystem
</ul>

<li>Provides cached access to slow remotely mounted filesystems
<li>For example NFS over a 11mbit network connection
</ul>
