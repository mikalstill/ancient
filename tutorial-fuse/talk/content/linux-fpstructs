TITLE: Structures of function pointers

<ul>
<li>One common implementation technique in the Linux kernel is to pass structures containing function pointers around
<li>This makes it a lot easier to implement pluggable code such as modules
<li>For example when you register a new USB driver, you pass the kernel a structure listing the functions to call for common events
<li>The kernel then calls the relevant function when that event occurs

<ul><pre>
static struct usb_driver ov511_driver = {
        .owner =        THIS_MODULE,
        .name =         "ov511",
        .id_table =     device_table,
        .probe =        ov51x_probe,
        .disconnect =   ov51x_disconnect
};
</pre></ul>

<li><i>probe</i> is called for device insert (to determine if this is an OV511)
<li><i>disconnect</i> is used for device removal
</ul>
