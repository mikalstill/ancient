TITLE: Why can't FUSE provide default behaviours for a lot of those?

<ul>
<li>There are a lot of operations there which need to be implemented
<li>For a writethrough filesystem or my caching filesystem a lot of them just use the existing system call
<li>Why can't FUSE just provide these for me?

<BR><BR>

<li>FUSE doesn't know where your data is
<li>The normal syscall might not be appropriate to your filesystem
<li>How do you tell FUSE to use the default behaviour?

</ul>
