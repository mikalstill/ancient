TITLE: getdir

<ul>
<li>The man page for readdir() doesn't specify the values for type
<li>The glibc manual says:

<pre>
unsigned char d_type
    This is the type of the file, possibly unknown. The following constants are
defined for its value:

    DT_UNKNOWN
        The type is unknown. On some systems this is the only value returned.

    DT_REG
        A regular file.

    DT_DIR
        A directory.

    DT_FIFO
        A named pipe, or FIFO. See section 15.3 FIFO Special Files.

    DT_SOCK
        A local-domain socket.

    DT_CHR
        A character device.

    DT_BLK
        A block device. 

    This member is a BSD extension. The symbol _DIRENT_HAVE_D_TYPE is defined i
this member is available. On systems where it is used, it corresponds to the 
file type bits in the st_mode member of struct statbuf. If the value cannot be 
determine the member value is DT_UNKNOWN.
