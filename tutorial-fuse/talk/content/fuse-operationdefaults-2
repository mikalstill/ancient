TITLE: Why can't FUSE provide default behaviours for a lot of those?

<ul>
<li>We can answer a few of those:

<BR><BR>

<li>Specify the default by passing -1 as the function pointer?
<li>Specify a path to prepend to the path of the object being accessed
<li>If the syscall doesn't map to your needs, then you're always going to have to provide it anyway.

%% TODO: Write a patch to implement this...
