TITLE: Why would you want a custom filesystem?

<ul>
<li>I first encountered FUSE because I wanted a custom filesystem
<li>Generate regression test data for image coding
<li>These images are relatively inexpensive to create
<li>Therefore the performance hit from generating them on the fly is not too bad
</ul>

%% Here I am talking about my need to generate a bunch
%% of test images for my image coding. TIFF supports
%% many different variations on the same valid header,
%% and to be able to regression test you need to be able
%% to push all of these through your pogram to test for
%% errors. Storing thousands of versions of the same
%% image gets boring quite fast however, which is where
%% the userspace filesystem comes in.
