TITLE: Why would you want a custom filesystem

<ul>
<li>I first encountered FUSE because I wanted a custom filesystem
<li>In my case I wanted something which would make it easy to generate test data
<li>A lot of my imaging code needs lots of input to regression test
<li>These are essentially the same image over and over again, with compression options changed
<li>I don't really want to store the same image several thousand times if I can avoid it
<li>These images are relatively inexpensive to create
</ul>
