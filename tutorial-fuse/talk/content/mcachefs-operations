TITLE: The fuse_operations structure from mcachefs

<ul>
<li>That previous fuse_operations structure was taken from mcachefs
<li>Which implements every possible operation
<li>You don't have to implement them all
<li>Either leave the unwanted ones undefined, or set them to null
<li>As we did for addfs:

<pre>
static struct fuse_operations addfs_oper = {
    .getattr	= addfs_getattr,
    .open	= addfs_open,
    .read	= addfs_read
};
</pre></ul>
