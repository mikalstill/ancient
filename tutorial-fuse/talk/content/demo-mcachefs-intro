TITLE: A quick mcachefs demo

<ul>
<li>For this demo we're going to need a slow filesystem
<li>To be able to demo it, we're going to need a slow filesystem to talk to
<BR><BR>
<li>Introducing yet another custom filesystem -- waitfs
<li>Performs the file operation you request, after an arbitary wait
<li>It's not a good simulation of a latent network, because it doesn't account for the size of the transfer
<li>It's good enough for our demo though
</ul>
