NAME
     uufilter - decode uuencoded files to stdout

SYNOPSIS
     _u_u_f_i_l_t_e_r [-f _o_u_t_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e] [-l] [-s] [-v] [_i_n_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]

DESCRIPTION
     _U_u_f_i_l_t_e_r is  a  "smart"  uuencoded  file  decoder  that  can
     optionally dump the file to stdout.

     If no filename is supplied, input is read from stdin.

     _U_u_f_i_l_t_e_r automatically ignores lines that do not  appear  to
     be  part of the uuencoded file.  This is particularly useful
     in uudecoding files that have been concatenated from several
     email  or news postings without stripping off the headers or
     otherwise editting extraneous content.

OPTIONS
     -f _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
             Dump output to _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e rather than the name  speci-
             fied in the uuencoded file.

     -l      Lenient mode.  This is useful if  passed  through  a
             mailer that adds trailing spaces.

     -s      Dump output to stdout rather than  to  the  filename
             indicated in the uuencoded file.

     -v      Verbose mode; talks about what's going on.
