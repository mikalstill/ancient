>TIFF is an extremely common, but quite complex raster image format. Libtiff is a standard implementation of the TIFF specification, which is free and works on many operating systems. This article discusses some of the pitfalls of TIFF, and guides the reader through use of the libtiff library. This article provides examples on how to use libtiff for your black and white imaging needs.</P
><P
>TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a raster image format which was originally produced by Adobe. Raster image formats are those which store the picture as a bitmap describing the state of pixels, as opposed to recording the length and locations of primatives such as lines and curves. Libtiff is one of the standard implementations of the TIFF specification, and is in wide use today because of its speed, power and easy source availability.</P
><P
>This article focuses on black and white TIFF images, there isn't enough space in the article to cover color images as well. These will be covered in another article in a later edition of DeveloperWorks.</P

Most file format specifications define some basic rules for the representation of the file. For instance, PNG (a compeditor to TIFF) documents are always big endian. TIFF doesn't mandate things like this though, here is a list of some of the seemingly basic things that it doesn't define:

<P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>The byte order -- big endian, or little endian</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The fill order of the bit within the image bytes -- most significant bit first, or least significant</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The meaning of a given pixel value for black and white -- is 0 black, or white?</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>...and so on</P
></LI
></OL
></P
><P
>This means that creating a TIFF can be very easy, because it is rare to have to do any conversion of the data that you already have. It does mean, on the other hand, that being able to read in random tiffs created by other applications can be very hard -- you have to code for all these possible combinations in order to be reasonably certain of having a reliable product.</P
><P
>So how do you write an application which can read in all these different possible permutations of the TIFF format? The most important thing to remember is to <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>never make assumptions about the format of the image data you are reading in</I
>.</P

In the block of code below, we will setup libtiff, and create a simple buffer which contains an image which we can then write out to disc.</P

These fields give libtiff information about the size and shape of the image, as well as the way that data will be compresed within the image.

><P
>Reading TIFF files reliably is much harder than writing them. Unfortunately, I don't have enough space in this article to discuss all of the important issues. Some of them will need to be left to later articles. There are also plenty of pages on the web which discuss the issues involved. Some of my favourites are included in the references section at the end of this article.</P
><P
>The issue that complicates reading black and white TIFF images the most is the several different storage schemes which are possible within the TIFF file itself. libtiff doesn't hold your hand much with these schemes, so you have to be able to handle them yourself. The three schemes TIFF supports are single stripped images, stripped images, and tiled images.</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>A single strip image is as the name suggests -- a special case of a stripped image. In this case, all of the bitmap is stored in one large block. I have experienced reliability issues with images which are single strip on Windows machines. The general recommendation is that no one strip should take more than 8 kilobytes uncompressed which with black and white images limits us to 65,536 pixels in a single strip.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>A multiple strip image is where horizontal blocks of the image are stored together. More than one stip is joined vertically to make the entire bitmap. Figure 2 shows this concept.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>A tiled image is like your bathroom wall, it is composed of tiles. This representation is show in Figure 3, and is useful for extremely large images -- this is especially true when you might only want to manipulate a small portion of the image at any one time.</P

>The most important thing to remember when reading in TIFF images is to be flexible. The example below has the same basic concepts as the writing example above, with the major difference being that it needs to deal with many possible input images. Apart from stripping and tiling, the most important thing to remember to be flexible about is photometric interpretation. Luckily, with black and white images there are only two photometric interpretations to worry about (with colour and to a certain extent grayscale images there are many more).</P
><P
>What is photometric interpretation? Well, the representation of the image in the buffer is really a very arbitary thing. I might code my bitmaps so that 0 means black (TIFFTAG_MINISBLACK), whilst you might find black being 1 (TIFFTAG_MINISWHITE) more convenient. TIFF allows both, so our code has to be able to handle both cases. In the example below, I have assumed that the internal buffers need to be in MINISWHITE, so we will convert images which are in MINISBLACK.</P
><P
>The other big thing to bear in mind is fillorder (whether the first bit in the byte is the highest value, or the lowest). The example below also handles both of these correctly. I have assumed that we want the buffer to have the most significant bit first. TIFF images can be either big endian or little endian, but libtiff handles this for us. Thankfully, libtiff also supports the various compression algorithms without you having to worry about those. These are by far the scariest area of TIFF, so it is still worth your time to use libtiff.</P

>This code works by first opening the image and checking that it is one that we can handle. It then reads in all the strip for the image, and appends them together in one large memory block.
