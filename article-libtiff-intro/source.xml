   <abstract>TIFF is an extremely common, but quite complex raster image format. Libtiff is a standard implementation of the TIFF specification, which is free and works on many operating systems. This article discusses some of the pitfalls of TIFF, and guides the reader through use of the libtiff library.</abstract>

<p>TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a raster image format which was originally produced by <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a>. Raster image formats are those which store the picture as a bitmap describing the state of pixels, as opposed to recording the length and locations of primatives such as lines and curves. Libtiff is one of the standard implementations of the TIFF specification, and is in wide use today because of its speed, power and easy source availability.</p>

<p>This article focuses on black and white TIFF images, there ins't enough space in the article to cover color images as well. These will be covered in another article in a later edition of DeveloperWorks.</p>

<p><heading refname="hard" type="major" toc="yes">Coding for TIFF can be hard</heading>	
Most file format specifications define some basic rules for the representation of the file. For instance, PNG<CHECKTHIS> (a compeditor to TIFF) documents are always big endian. TIFF doesn't mandate things like this though, here is a list of some of the seemingly basic things that it doesn't define:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The byte order -- big endian, or little endian
  <li>The fill order of the bit within the image bytes -- most significant bit first, or least significant
  <li>The meaning of a given pixel value for black and white -- is 0 black, or white?
  <li>...and so on
</ul>

<p>This means that creating a TIFF can be very easy, because it is rare to have to do any conversion of the data that you already have. It does mean, on the other hand, that being able to read in random tiff created by other applications can be very hard -- you have to code for all these possible combinations in order to be reasonably certain of having a reliable product.</p>
	
<p>So how do you write an application which can read in all these different possible permutations of the TIFF format? Well, there are some basic guidelines to follow, which will make your life easier. The most important of these is: <i>never make an assumption</i>.</p>

<p><heading refname="hard" type="major" toc="yes">Writing TIFF files</heading>
The first thing I want to do is show you how to write a TIFF file out. We'll then get onto how to read a TIFF file back into your program.</p>
	
<p><heading refname="infrastructure-read" type="minor" toc="yes">Infrastructure for reading</heading>
It is traditional for bitmaps to be represented inside your code with an array of chars. This is because on most operating systems, a char maps well to one byte. In the block of code below, we will setup libtiff, and create a simple buffer which contains an image which we can then write out to disc.</p>

<code type="section">
<heading refname="infrastructure-read-code" type="code" toc="no">Setting up the infrastructure</heading>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <tiffio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
  char *buffer;
}
</code>

<p>The code above is pretty simple. All you need to use libtiff is to include the tiffio.h header file. To compile this, use the command <code type="inline">gcc foo.c -o foo -ltiff -lm</code>. The <code type="inline">-ltiff</code> is a command which will include the library named libtiff, which needs to be in your library path. Once you have started specifing libraries explicitly, you also need to add <code type="inline">-lm</code>, which is the mathematics library. The char buffer that we have defined here is going to be our black and white image, so we should define one of those next...</p>
