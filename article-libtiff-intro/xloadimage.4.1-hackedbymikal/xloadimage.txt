NAME
     xloadimage, xsetbg, xview - load images into an  X11  window
     or onto the root window

SYNOPSIS
     _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e [global_options] {[image_options] image ...}
     _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e [global_options] [image_options] stdin < image

DESCRIPTION
     _X_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e displays images in an X11 window, loads them onto
     the  root  window,  or  writes them into a file.  Many image
     types are recognized; use  the  -_s_u_p_p_o_r_t_e_d  option  to  list
     them.

     If the filename _s_t_d_i_n is given,  xloadimage  will  read  the
     image from standard input if this capability is supported by
     the loader for that image type (most types do support  read-
     ing from stdin).

     If the destination display  cannot  support  the  number  of
     colors  in the image, the image will be dithered (monochrome
     destination) or have its colormap  reduced  (color  destina-
     tion)  as  appropriate.  This can also be done forcibly with
     the -_h_a_l_f_t_o_n_e, -_d_i_t_h_e_r, and -_c_o_l_o_r_s options.

     A variety of image manipulations can be specified, including
     gamma  correction,  brightening, clipping, dithering, depth-
     reduction, rotation, and zooming.  Most of  these  manipula-
     tions have simple implementations; speed was opted for above
     accuracy.

     If you are viewing a large image in a  window,  the  initial
     window will be at most 90% of the size of the display unless
     the window manager does not  correctly  handle  window  size
     requests  or if you've used the -_f_u_l_l_s_c_r_e_e_n option.  You may
     move the image around in the window  by  dragging  with  the
     first  mouse  button.  The cursor will indicate which direc-
     tions you may drag, if any.  You may exit the window by typ-
     ing 'q' or '^C' when the keyboard focus is on the window.

     If more than one image file  is  specified  on  the  command
     line, each image will be shown in order (except if -_m_e_r_g_e or
     -_g_o_t_o are being used).

     A wide variety of common image manipulations can be done  by
     mixing  and matching the available options.  See the section
     entitled _H_I_N_T_S _F_O_R _G_O_O_D _I_M_A_G_E _D_I_S_P_L_A_Y_S for some ideas.

     The -_d_u_m_p option causes an image to be  written  to  a  file
     rather  than displayed after processing.  This allows you to
     read an image, perform a number of processing operations  on
     it,   and  save  the  resultant  image.   This  also  allows

     translation from any of the recognized image types into  any
     of the formats that support dumping.

     _X_s_e_t_b_g is equivalent to _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e -_o_n_r_o_o_t -_q_u_i_e_t and  _x_v_i_e_w
     is equivalent to _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e -_v_i_e_w -_v_e_r_b_o_s_e.

RESOURCE CLASS
     _X_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e uses the resource class name _X_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e for  win-
     dow  managers  which  need  this  resource  set.   This name
     changed in version 2.00 and  2.01;  some  previous  versions
     used the name _X_L_o_a_d_I_m_a_g_e (which was difficult to predict) or
     _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e (which conflicted with class naming conventions).

GLOBAL OPTIONS
     The  following  options  affect  the  global  operation   of
     _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e.   They  may be specified anywhere on the command
     line.  Additionally the -_g_l_o_b_a_l option can be used to  force
     an image option to apply to all images.

     -border _c_o_l_o_r
             This sets the background portion of the window which
             is not covered by any images to be _c_o_l_o_r.

     -configuration
             Displays the image path, image  suffixes,  and  sup-
             ported  filters  which will be used when looking for
             and  reading  images.    These   are   loaded   from
             ~/.xloadimagerc  and  optionally  from  a systemwide
             file   (normally    /usr/lib/xloadimagerc).     This
             replaces the -path option.

     -default
             Use the default  root  weave  as  the  image.   This
             option  forces  -_o_n_r_o_o_t.  If -_d_e_f_a_u_l_t is used alone,
             it is the same as _x_s_e_t_r_o_o_t with  no  arguments.   If
             used  in  conjunction  with -_t_i_l_e this option can be
             used to place images on the default root weave  (see
             EXAMPLES below).

     -debug  Talk to the X server in synchronous mode.   This  is
             useful  for  debugging.  If an X error is seen while
             in this mode, a core will be dumped.

     -delay _s_e_c_s
             Automatically advance to the next image  after  _s_e_c_s
             seconds.

     -display _d_i_s_p_l_a_y__n_a_m_e
             X11 display name to send the image(s) to.

     -dump _i_m_a_g_e__t_y_p_e[,_o_p_t_i_o_n[=_v_a_l_u_e]] _d_u_m_p__f_i_l_e
             Rather than  displaying  the  loaded  and  processed

             image,  dump  it into an image file of the specified
             type.  For a list of image types that can be dumped,
             use  the  -_s_u_p_p_o_r_t_e_d  option.  Some image types have
             options that affect the format of  the  file  that's
             created.   See  DUMP OPTIONS below.  An image can be
             dumped in any supported dump  format  regardless  of
             the original image type, so image file type transla-
             tion is possible using this option.

     -fit    Force image to use the default visual and  colormap.
             This  is  useful  if  you  do  not  want technicolor
             effects when the colormap focus is inside the  image
             window,  but  it  may  reduce  the  quality  of  the
             displayed image.  This is on by default  if  -onroot
             or -windowid is specified.

     -fork   Fork xloadimage.  This causes xloadimage to disasso-
             ciate  itself from the shell.  This option automati-
             cally turns on -quiet.

     -fullscreen
             Use the entire screen to display  images.   If  com-
             bined with -onroot, the image will be zoomed to fill
             the entire rootwindow.

     -geometry _W_x_H[{+-_X}{+-}_Y]
             This sets the size of  the  window  onto  which  the
             images are loaded to a different value than the size
             of the image.  When viewing an image  in  a  window,
             this  can be used to reduce the size of the destina-
             tion window.  When loading an image  onto  the  root
             window,  this option controls the size of the pixmap
             which will be loaded onto the root.  If the size  is
             smaller  than that of the display, the image will be
             replicated.

     -goto image_name
             Forces the next image to  be  displayed  to  be  the
             image named _i_m_a_g_e__n_a_m_e.  This is useful for generat-
             ing looped slideshows.  If more than  one  image  of
             the  same  name as the target exists on the argument
             list, the first in the argument list is used.

     -help [option ...]
             Give information on an option or  list  of  options.
             If  no  option  is  given, a simple interactive help
             facility is invoked.

     -identify
             Identify the supplied  images  rather  than  display
             them.

     -install
             Forcibly install the image's colormap when the  win-
             dow  is  focused.  This violates ICCCM standards and
             only exists to allow  operation  with  naive  window
             managers.   Use  this  option  only  if  your window
             manager does not install colormaps properly.

     -list   List the images which are along the image path.

     -onroot Load image(s) onto the root window instead of  view-
             ing in a window.  This option automatically sets the
             -fit option.  This is the opposite of -_v_i_e_w.  _X_S_e_t_b_g
             has this option set by default.

     -path   Displays miscellaneous information about the program
             configuration.  This option is obsolete and has been
             replaced by -configuration.

     -pixmap Force the use of a pixmap as backing-store.  This is
             provided  for  servers where backing-store is broken
             (such as some versions of  the  AIXWindows  server).
             It  may  improve  scrolling  performance  on servers
             which provide backing-store.

     -private
             Force the  use  of  a  private  colormap.   Normally
             colors  are  allocated  shared  unless there are not
             enough colors available.

     -quiet  Forces _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e and _x_v_i_e_w to be  quiet.   This  is
             the default for _x_s_e_t_b_g, but the others like to whis-
             tle.

     -supported
             List the supported image types.

     -type _t_y_p_e__n_a_m_e
             Forces _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e to try to load the image as a par-
             ticular file type rather than trying to guess.  This
             often improves load performance noticably.

     -verbose
             Causes _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e to be talkative, telling you  what
             kind of image it's playing with and any special pro-
             cessing that it has to do. This is the  default  for
             _x_v_i_e_w and _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e.

     -version
             Print the version number and patchlevel of this ver-
             sion of _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e.

             -_o_n_r_o_o_t and the default for _x_v_i_e_w and _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e.

     -visual _v_i_s_u_a_l__n_a_m_e
             Force the use of a specific visual type  to  display
             an  image.   Normally  _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e  tries to pick the
             best available image for a  particular  image  type.
             The   available   visual  types  are:   DirectColor,
             TrueColor, PseudoColor, StaticColor, GrayScale,  and
             StaticGray.  Nonconflicting names may be abbreviated
             and case is ignored.

     -windowid _h_e_x__w_i_n_d_o_w__i_d
             Sets the background pixmap of  a  particular  window
             ID.  The argument must be in hexadecimal and must be
             preceeded by "0x" (_e_g -windowid 0x40000b.   This  is
             intended  for  setting the background pixmap of some
             servers which use untagged  virtual  roots  (_e_g  HP-
             VUE), but can have other interesting applications.

IMAGE OPTIONS
     The following options may preceed each image.  These options
     are local to the image they preceed.

     -at _X,_Y
          Indicates coordinates to load the image at on the  base
          image.   If  this  is an option to the first image, and
          the -_o_n_r_o_o_t option is  specified,  the  image  will  be
          loaded at the given location on the display background.

     -background _c_o_l_o_r
          Use _c_o_l_o_r  as  the  background  color  instead  of  the
          default  (usually  white  but this depends on the image
          type) if you are transferring a monochrome image  to  a
          color display.

     -brighten _p_e_r_c_e_n_t_a_g_e
          Specify a percentage multiplier  for  a  color  image's
          colormap.   A  value  of more than 100 will brighten an
          image, one of less than 100 will darken it.

     -center
          Center the image on the base image loaded.  If this  is
          an option to the first image, and the -_o_n_r_o_o_t option is
          specified, the image will be centered  on  the  display
          background.

     -clip _X,_Y,_W,_H
          Clip the image before loading it.  _X and _Y  define  the
          upper-left  corner of the clip area, and _W and _H define
          the extents of the area.  A zero value for _W or _H  will
          be interpreted as the remainder of the image.

     -colors _n
          Specify the maximum number of  colors  to  use  in  the
          image.   This  is a way to forcibly reduce the depth of
          an image.

     -dither
          Dither a color  image  to  monochrome  using  a  Floyd-
          Steinberg dithering algorithm.  This happens by default
          when viewing color  images  on  a  monochrome  display.
          This  is  slower  than  -_h_a_l_f_t_o_n_e and affects the image
          accuracy but usually looks much better.

     -foreground _c_o_l_o_r
          Use _c_o_l_o_r as the foreground color instead of  black  if
          you  are  transferring  a  monochrome  image to a color
          display.  This can also be used  to  invert  the  fore-
          ground and background colors of a monochrome image.

     -gamma _d_i_s_p_l_a_y__g_a_m_m_a
          Specify the gamma  correction  for  the  display.   The
          default  value  is  1.0, a typical display needs 2.0 to
          2.5.

     -global
          Force the following  option  to  apply  to  all  images
          rather  than  one  specific image.  Local image options
          will temporarily override  any  option  specified  with
          -global.

     -gray
          Convert an image to grayscale.   This  is  very  useful
          when displaying colorful images on servers with limited
          color capability.  It can also be  used  to  convert  a
          bitmap  image  into  a  grayscale  image,  although the
          resulting image will be smaller than the original.  The
          optional spelling -_g_r_e_y may also be used.

     -halftone
          Force halftone dithering of a color image when display-
          ing on a monochrome display.  This option is ignored on
          monochrome images.  This dithering algorithm  blows  an
          image  up by sixteen times; if you don't like this, the
          -_d_i_t_h_e_r option will not blow the image up but will take
          longer to process and will be less accurate.

     -idelay _s_e_c_s
          Set the delay to be used for this image to _s_e_c_s seconds
          (see  -_d_e_l_a_y).  If -_d_e_l_a_y was specified, this overrides
          it.  If it was not specified, this sets  the  automatic
          advance delay for this image while others will wait for
          the user to advance them.

     -invert
          Inverts a monochrome  image.   This  is  shorthand  for
          -_f_o_r_e_g_r_o_u_n_d _w_h_i_t_e -_b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d _b_l_a_c_k.

     -merge
          Merge this image onto the base image after  local  pro-
          cessing.   The base image is considered to be the first
          image specified or the last image  that  was  not  pre-
          ceeded  by -_m_e_r_g_e.  If used in conjunction with -_a_t and
          -_c_l_i_p, very complex  images  can  be  built  up.   This
          option  is  on by default for all images if the -_o_n_r_o_o_t
          or -_w_i_n_d_o_w_i_d options are specified.

     -name _i_m_a_g_e__n_a_m_e
          Force the next argument to be treated as an image name.
          This is useful if the name of the image is -_d_i_t_h_e_r, for
          instance.

     -newoptions
          Reset globally-specified options.

     -normalize
          Normalize a color image.

     -rotate _d_e_g_r_e_e_s
          Rotate the image by _d_e_g_r_e_e_s clockwise.  The number must
          be a multiple of 90.

     -shrink
          Shrink an image down to fit on the  display.   This  is
          particularly  useful  with  servers that do not support
          window  sizes  larger  than  the  physical  screen  (eg
          DECWINDOWS servers).

     -smooth
          Smooth a color image.  This  reduces  blockiness  after
          zooming  an  image  up.  If used on a monochrome image,
          nothing happens.  This option can take awhile  to  per-
          form, especially on large images.  You may specify more
          than one -_s_m_o_o_t_h option  per  image,  causing  multiple
          iterations of the smoothing algorithm.

     -tile
          Tile this image (after any necessary merging or tiling)
          to  create a fullscreen image.  This is usually used to
          create a large background image on which to merge other
          images.   -_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y  can  be  used to set the new image
          size to something other than -fullscreen.

     -title _t_i_t_l_e
          Change the title of the image.  This sets the title bar
          title  if displaying in a window or the NIFF file image

     -xzoom _p_e_r_c_e_n_t_a_g_e
          Zoom the X axis of an image by  _p_e_r_c_e_n_t_a_g_e.   A  number
          greater  than  100  will  expand the image, one smaller
          will compress it.  A zero value will be ignored.   This
          option,  and the related -_y_z_o_o_m are useful for correct-
          ing the aspect ratio of images to be displayed.

     -yzoom _p_e_r_c_e_n_t_a_g_e
          Zoom the Y axis of an image by _p_e_r_c_e_n_t_a_g_e.  See  -_x_z_o_o_m
          for more information.

     -zoom _p_e_r_c_e_n_t_a_g_e
          Zoom both the X and Y axes by _p_e_r_c_e_n_t_a_g_e.   See  -_x_z_o_o_m
          for more information.  Technically the percentage actu-
          ally zoomed is the square of the number supplied  since
          the  zoom  is to both axes, but I opted for consistency
          instead of accuracy.

EXAMPLES
     To load the rasterfile "my.image" onto  the  background  and
     replicate it to fill the entire background:

          xloadimage -onroot my.image

     To center an image on the default root background:

          xloadimage -default -tile my.image

     If using a monochrome display and a  color  image  you  will
     probably want to dither the image for a cleaner (and faster)
     display:

          xloadimage -default -tile -dither my.image

     To load a monochrome image "my.image" onto  the  background,
     using  red as the foreground color, replicate the image, and
     overlay "another.image" onto it at coordinate (10,10):

          xloadimage   -foreground   red   my.image   -at   10,10
     another.image

     To center the rectangular region from 10 to 110 along the  X
     axis  and  from  10  to  the height of the image along the Y
     axis:

          xloadimage -center -clip 10,10,100,0 my.image

     To double the size of an image:

          xloadimage -zoom 200 my.image

     To halve the size of an image:

          xloadimage -zoom 50 my.image

     To brighten a dark image:

          xloadimage -brighten 150 my.image

HINTS FOR GOOD IMAGE DISPLAYS
     Since images are likely to come from a variety  of  sources,
     they  may  be in a variety of aspect ratios which may not be
     supported by your display.  The -_x_z_o_o_m  and  -_y_z_o_o_m  options
     can  be  used  to change the aspect ratio of an image before
     display.  If you use these options, it is  recommended  that
     you  increase  the  size of one of the dimensions instead of
     shrinking the other, since  shrinking  looses  detail.   For
     instance,  many  GIF  and G3 FAX images have an X:Y ratio of
     about 2:1.  You can  correct  this  for  viewing  on  a  1:1
     display  with  either -_x_z_o_o_m _5_0 or -_y_z_o_o_m _2_0_0 (reduce X axis
     to 50% of its size and expand Y axis to 200%  of  its  size,
     respectively)  but the latter should be used so no detail is
     lost in the conversion.

     When zooming color images up you can reduce blockiness  with
     -_s_m_o_o_t_h.  For zooms of 300% or more, I recommend two smooth-
     ing passes (although this can take  awhile  to  do  on  slow
     machines).   There  will  be  a noticable improvement in the
     image.

     You can perform image processing on a small  portion  of  an
     image  by  loading  the  image  more than once and using the
     -_m_e_r_g_e, -_a_t and -_c_l_i_p options.  Load the image,  then  merge
     it with a clipped, processed version of itself.  To brighten
     a  100x100  rectangular  portion  of  an  image  located  at
     (50,50), for instance, you could type:

          xloadimage   my.image   -merge    -at    50,50    -clip
     50,50,100,100 -brighten 150 my.image

     If you're using a display with a small colormap  to  display
     colorful  images,  try  using the -_g_r_a_y option to convert to
     grayscale.

PATHS AND EXTENSIONS
     The file ~/.xloadimagerc (and optionally a system-wide file)
     defines  a  number  of  configuration  options  that  affect
     xloadimage.

     This file is split into three section, the _p_a_t_h section, the
     _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n section, and the _f_i_l_t_e_r section.  The sections are
     identified by typing the section name followed by an  equals
     sign, eg "path =".

     The _p_a_t_h statement is used to provide a set of search  paths
     to  use  when  looking  for  an  image  of a specified name.
     Separate each path in the list by whitespace (eg one or more
     spaces,  tabs,  or  newlines).   The path is searched in the
     order it is specified.  For example:

       path = ~/images /usr/local/images ~fred

     will first look for the image name you specified, then  look
     for the name in ~/images (the tilde is expanded to the value
     of $HOME), then in /usr/local/images, then  in  user  fred's
     home directory.  This allows easy use of image repositories.

     The _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n statement is used to provide a set of  default
     extensions  to  use when looking for an image of a specified
     name.  Separate each extension in the  list  by  whitespace.
     The  extensions  are searched in the order in which they are
     specified.  For example:

       extension = .gif .jpg

     If you have a file named _m_y_i_m_a_g_e._g_i_f you could  specify  the
     name  _m_y_i_m_a_g_e and xloadimage would append the ._g_i_f extension
     automatically.

     The _f_i_l_t_e_r statement is used to  describe  filter  programs,
     such as "uncompress", which are to be applied to image files
     automatically.  You  specify  one  filter  program  and  any
     number  of  recognized  extensions following the _f_i_l_t_e_r key-
     word.  For example:

       filter = uncompress .Z

     specifies that the program _u_n_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s should be  used  as  a
     filter  whenever  an  image  file  has  a  .Z extension.  By
     default filters are provided for compressed (.Z)  files  and
     GNU  zip  (.gz)  files.   See  the  FILTERS section for more
     information on defining your own filters.

     Any text on a line following a hash-mark (#) is ignored;  if
     you  wish to use a hash-mark in a path, extension, or filter
     you can escape it using a backslash (\).

     If you wish to include white-space in a filter program name,
     path,  or  extension  you  can  enclose  the  entire text in
     double-quotes.  For example:

       filter = "gzip -cd" .gz

     Use backslash (\) characters to allow inclusion  of  double-
     quote marks or newlines.

     The following is a sample ~/.xloadimagerc file:

       # paths to look for images in
       path = /usr/local/images        # system image repository
             ~/images                 # personal images
             /usr/include/X11/bitmaps # standard X bitmaps

       # default extensions for images
       extension = .csun .msun .sun .face .xbm .bm

       # invoke GNU zip if a .z or .zip extension is found
       filter = "gzip -cd" .z .zip


IMAGE TYPES
     _X_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e currently supports many common and some  uncommon
     image  types, and can create images in several formats.  For
     a complete list use the -_s_u_p_p_o_r_t_e_d option.

DUMPING IMAGES
     Several image dumpers are  included  that  can  be  used  to
     create  a  new image after loading and processing.  The NIFF
     (Native Image File  Format)  is  the  simplest  and  creates
     images  that  _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e  can read the fastest; it is essen-
     tially a copy of the internal image format.

     Some image dumpers allow options that affect the image  out-
     put.  These options are appended to the image type following
     a comma and are separated by commas.  If a value is  desired
     it  can be specified following an equals-sign.  For example,
     to create a monochrome JPEG image file with a quality factor
     of 80, you would use the following command line:

       xloadimage image_name -dump jpeg,quality=80,grayscale new_image.jpg

     Option names can be abbreviated but if the  abbreviation  is
     too  short  to  be  unique  the option which will be used is
     indeterminate.

FILTERS
     Xloadimage supports automatic filtering by recognizing  file
     extensions.   By  default  "compress"  and  "gzip" files are
     recognized and their names passed to appropriate commands to
     decompress them.

     The  xloadimage  distribution  includes  a  special  "smart"
     uudecoder, called _u_u_f_i_l_t_e_r that can be used to automatically

     uudecode files for processing.  _U_u_f_i_l_t_e_r ignores  extraneous
     lines  in the file so it is particularly useful if the uuen-
     coded file was created by concatenating email or news  post-
     ings that had headers or line-break indicators included.

     To make use of _u_u_f_i_l_t_e_r you can add the following to your

       filter = "uufilter -s" .uu .uue
     The filter will be automatically invoked on any file with  a
     .uu or

     For a list of filters automatically recognized by xloadimage
     use the -_c_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_a_t_i_o_n option.

SUPPORTED IMAGE OPTIONS
     The JPEG image dumper supports the following options:

     arithmetic
             Use arithmetic encoding.

     grayscale
             Force a monochrome (grayscale) image to  be  created
             given a color image.

     nointerleave
             Create a non-interleaved file.

     optimize
             Enable entropy parameter optimization.

     quality Adjust the quality of the image to be created.   The
             default  quality  factor  is 75; lower values create
             poorer images.

     restart _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l
             Set the restart interval in MCU rows, or MCUs if 'b'
             follows the interval value.

     smooth _s_m_o_o_t_h_i_n_g__f_a_c_t_o_r
             Set the smoothing factor.  Value should be between 0
             and 100, inclusive.

     If you are not familiar with the meaning  of  these  options
     you  can  ask  the Independent JPEG Group (IJG) via email at
     jpeg@cs.columbia.edu.

     The PBM image dumper supports the following options:

     normal  Dump a normal (ascii) PBM/PPM file.

     raw     Dump a RawBits format PBM/PPM  file.   This  is  the
             default  and  results in significantly smaller image

             files than when using _n_o_r_m_a_l.

     There is no way to dump a PGM format file or a "compact" PBM
     format file (sorry).

     The TIFF image dumper supports the following options:

     compression
             Image data compression technique.  Can  be  one  of:
             _n_o_n_e  (no compression), _r_l_e (CCITT RLE compression),
             _g_3_f_a_x (CCITT Group 3 FAX compression), _g_4_f_a_x  (CCITT
             Group  4  FAX  compression),  _l_z_w  (Limpel-Ziv-Welsh
             compression, the default), _j_p_e_g (JPEG  compression),
             _n_e_x_t (NeXT run-length compression), _r_l_e_w (CCITT RLEW
             compression), _m_a_c (Macintosh PackBits  compression),
             _p_a_c_k_b_i_t_s  (same  as  _m_a_c),  _t_h_u_n_d_e_r_s_c_a_n (ThunderScan
             compression).

     _X_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e  will  save  using  the  MINISBLACK,  MINISWHITE,
     COLORMAP,  or RGB photometrics as appropriate for its inter-
     nal image format.  There is no way to specify  a  particular
     photometric or any other TIFF fields.

BUGS
     Zooming dithered images, especially downwards, is UGLY.

     Images can come in a variety of aspect  ratios.   _X_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e
     cannot  detect  what aspect ratio the particular image being
     loaded has, nor the aspect ratio of the destination display,
     so  images with differing aspect ratios from the destination
     display will appear distorted.  See  _H_I_N_T_S  _F_O_R  _G_O_O_D  _I_M_A_G_E
     _D_I_S_P_L_A_Y_S for more information.

     The GIF format allows more than one image to be stored in  a
     single GIF file, but _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e will only display the first.

     Only GIF87a format is supported.

     One of the pseudonyms for _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e,  _x_v_i_e_w,  is  the  same
     name  as  Sun  uses for their SunView-under-X package.  This
     will be confusing if you're one of those poor souls who  has
     to use Sun's XView.

     Some window managers do not  correctly  handle  window  size
     requests.   In  particular,  many versions of the twm window
     manager use the MaxSize hint  instead  of  the  PSize  hint,
     causing  images  which are larger than the screen to display
     in a window larger than the screen, something which is  nor-
     mally avoided.  Some versions of twm also ignore the MaxSize
     argument's real function, to limit the maximum size  of  the
     window,  and  allow the window to be resized larger than the
     image.  If this happens, _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e merely places the  image
     in  the  upper-left  corner of the window and uses the zero-
     value'ed pixel for any space which is  not  covered  by  the
     image.   This behavior is less-than-graceful but so are win-
     dow managers which are cruel enough to ignore such details.
