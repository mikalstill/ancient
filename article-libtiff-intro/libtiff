Many thanks for your interest in our site, and thank you for your
submission. I have forwarded your idea to our Linux zone editor for review.
If you do not hear from him within the next two weeks, please contact me.

Again, thank you for your readership and interest in developerWorks.

Subject: Libtiff article proposal

Michael,

Thanks very much for the proposal. You pitched it as a tutorial, but I'm
not clear whether you want to actually submit it in our tutorial format or
just write it as a regular article with a tutorial sort of flavor. I like
the topic, but I don't believe it warrants full tutorial treatment (and it
would be quite a bit more work on your part to format it). Please let me
know if you would be interested in submitting this as a regular article.

Second, where are you located? Unfortunately, we can't pay writers who live
in certain areas of the world, so it would help to know this up front.

Thanks, and I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

-Tom

Mikal,

Okay, great! Our usual article length is 1500-2000 words, and I pay
US$1,000 for articles of this type. If that sounds satisfactory, please let
me know when you think you can file it. I'll then send you a contract and
our article template and you'll be off.

My initial feeling was for a how-to kind of article, which is what you are
describing here. I have seen articles on the site which follow a similar
pattern to that I had in mind (for instance the introduction to Palm
development articles).

I guess what I am saying is that an article is what I was originally
intending, and therefore fine with me.

I am located in Canberra, Australia.

Let me know your thoughts,
Mikal

Okay, I've attached the template and a contract with a delivery date of
Feb. 11. Please don't feel the need to keep me abreast of your progress,
but if you think you're going to miss the deadline, please let me know as
early as possible. Of course, if you would like any advise along the way,
just ask. As far as editorial support, I read every article and almost
invariably send them back to writers with comments and questions that need
to be addressed. It's an iterative process.

Some general guidelines up front:

-Writing an outline ahead of time almost always improves things. It keeps
your thoughts together and makes the article flow more smoothly.
-Convey the necessary information, but don't be afraid to keep it personal.
Use first person if it's called for, and tell readers what you think ("I
researched graphics libraries extensively and consider libtiff the best
around," etc.)
-If a screen shot or illustration can demonstrate your point better than
words, please use it.
-Please don't forget to include a list of online resources (you'll see
where they go at the bottom of the template). They can be web sites, books,
community pages, etc. -- pretty much anything a reader might find useful in
trying to learn more about libtiff. The resources should be annotated with
descriptions of what they are (see most any developerWorks article for an
example).

Good luck, and I'm glad to be working with you!

-Tom

Cool. I would think that it will take two or so weeks from when I get the
article template... I can keep you informed of my progress if you would
like.

My other question is how much editorial support is provided? I haven't
written an article like this before, so it would be good to get feedback
as to how to improve me style et cetera for future articles...

Cheers,
Mikal
