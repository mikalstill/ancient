.TH "PLOT_SETLINEDASH" "3" "26 May 2003" "" ""

.SH NAME
plot_setlinedash \- sets the dashing pattern used to stroke lines
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
 #include&lt;libmplot.h&gt;
 void panda_setlinedash(plot_state *state, int length, char *dash);
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function takes the length of the dashing pattern (in bytes), and the dashing pattern itself. The dashing pattern is expressed in the form of a char * where a given byte is \\0 if the point is not to be drawn, or \\1 if it is to be drawn. See the example for an example...
</para>
<para>
This dashing pattern is applied by cycling through the pattern, one step per pixel drawn. This might not have the expected effect for think lines.
.SH "RETURNS"
.PP
Nothing

 plot_state *graph;
 if((graph = plot_newplot(400, 300)) == NULL){
