<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para> This function takes the length of the dashing pattern (in bytes), and the dashing pattern itself. The dashing pattern is expressed in the form of a char * where a given byte is \0 if the point is not to be drawn, or \1 if it is to be drawn. See the example for an example...
 &lt;/para&gt;
 
 &lt;para&gt;
 This dashing pattern is applied by cycling through the pattern, one step per pixel drawn. This might not have the expected effect for think lines.
