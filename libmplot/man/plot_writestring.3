 char *words[] = {"This", "is", "a", "string", "which", "is", "quite", "long.",
 "It", "demonstrates", "how", "to", "do", "word", "wrap", NULL};
 
 if((graph = plot_newplot(400, 300)) == NULL){

 }
 
 plot_setfontcolor(graph, 26, 22, 249);

 plot_settextlocation(graph, 20, 70);
 count = 0;
 while(words[count] != NULL){
 plot_gettextlocation(graph, &textx, &texty);
 if((textx + plot_stringwidth(graph, words[count])) > 380){
