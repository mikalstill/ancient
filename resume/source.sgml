<sect1><title>Current employment</title>
<para>
I am currently employed as a senior software engineer with TOWER Software Pty Ltd. This work involves management of complex exploratory development efforts, as well as project and product management and system development for our commercial software products.
</para>

<para>
The majority of my time is spent solving complex technical problems. These might be problems I have encountered myself while implementing a system, but also includes problems delegated from other members of the team. These problems have ranged from errors in complex pieces of code dealing with images at a bit level, network programming, system design and implementation, or solving problems related to Microsoft Windows development. I am also responsible for large amounts of development in areas which were previously poorly understood by TOWER.
</para>

<sect2><title>Examples of recent development experience</title>
<para>
The following examples of systems I have recently developed might be of some assistance.
</para>

<sect3><title>API work</title>
<para>
Panda, an open source PDF generation API. Panda supports all of the major PDF constructs, as well as containing JPEG, PNG and TIFF support. This involves low level manipulation of TIFF images into the subset of the TIFF specification that is supported by the PDF specification.
</para>

<para>
PandaLex, an open source PDF parsing engine. This involves a bison and flex parser where some of the information parsed is binary. This library allows PandaEdit to support modification of existing PDF documents, as well as aid the reverse engineering required for development of support for linearized PDF.
</para>

<para>
PandaScript, an open source scripting interface to Panda, which was developed using bison and flex.
</para>

<para>
A Web Service version of the extensive TRIM SDK.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Application work</title>
<para>
I have been involved with the implementation of various Internet based systems for IPAustralia, the Australian Patents, Trade Marks, and Designs offices. I have developed several large scale PDF generation applications for IPAustralia. These were developed in C using a PDF generation API, and partially led to the development of Panda.
</para>

<para>
Development of a standard data loading infrastructure for IPAustralia capable of dealing with a large range of data input from CD ROMs, DVDs, tapes and scanning applications. This infrastructure is based on a UNIX server process, and is responsible for the loading of 99% of the corporate mission critical data.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Large scaling image processing and storage</title>
<para>
A selection of imaging applications which involve low level manipulation of image data. These have used libtiff, libjpeg and are starting to use libpng. Types of applications developed include image conversion, text insertion and data extraction applications. These applications are developed as needed internally by IPAustralia.
</para>

<para>
The ongoing maintenance and development of several corporate imaging systems, ranging for 9 million TIFF images, to 500,000 TIFF images, to 200,000 PDF documents.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Commercial software development of a leading Records Management and EDMS product</title>
<para>
This has included implementation of the ODMA specification, the parsing of Microsoft structured storage files, MFC user interfaces, document content searching, a custom web server, and many other projects. Development was initially undertaken under win32 using COM and DCOM in C++. Subsequently some development work was undertaken in C# using the Microsoft .NET Framework and Microsoft .NET Compact Framework.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>System Testing</title>
<para>
I believe that proper testing of code before release is important. At one of my previous jobs (in the list below), I was a member of the team responsible for the testing of a complex Internet application for Australia's largest telecommunications company. This involved the generation of use cases, test scripts, the planning of regression, unit and occasionally acceptance testing, and the implementation of this testing.
</para>

<para>
I have previously been  responsible for the acceptance testing for the Windows and Unix APIs for an EDMS / Workflow suite from Objective Corporation.
</para>

<para>
I have also liaised with the Quality Assurance team at TOWER Software on many occasions, and understand the issues involved with testing of complex commercial software packages.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Kernel development</title>
<para>
I have a contributed a variety of patches to the Linux kernel, starting with the late part of the 2.5 development series. Many of these patches are janitorial in nature, although I have also worked on the kernel-doc documentation infrastructure. For more information about the current status of my kernel patches, you can check my patch tracker at: http://www.stillhq.com/cgi-bin/patchtrack?dir=linux/patches
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Other</title>
<para>
I have also been involved with many other coding and systems administration projects, the above a merely some recent highlights. These include web based, Windows based, and UNIX based systems. I have also undertaken mainframe integration work. I have been involved with the support of various mission critical systems.
</para>
