<sect1><title>Current employment</title>
<para>
I am currently employed as a senior software engineer with TOWER Software Pty Ltd. This work involves management of complex exploratory development efforts, as well as project management and system development for our commercial software products
</para>

<para>
The majority of my time is spent solving complex technical problems. These might be problems I have encountered myself while implementing a system, but also includes problems delegated from other members of the team. These problems have ranged from errors in complex pieces of code dealing with images at a bit level, generating PDF documents from scratch, or solving problems related to Microsoft Windows development. I am also responsible for large amounts of development in areas which were previously poorly understood by TOWER.
</para>

<sect2><title>Examples of recent development experience</title>
<para>
The following examples of systems I have recently developed might be of some assistance.
</para>

<sect3><title>API work</title>
<para>
Panda, an open source PDF generation API is currently under development and is available for download . Panda supports all of the major PDF constructs, as well as containing JPEG and TIFF support. This involves low level manipulation of TIFF images into the subset of the TIFF specification that is supported by the PDF specification.
</para>

<para>
PandaLex, an open source PDF parsing engine, which is currently nearing it first public release. This involves a bison and flex parser where some of the information parsed is binary. This library will allow Panda to support modification of existing PDF documents, as well as aid the reverse engineering required for development of support for linearized PDF .
</para>

<para>
PandaScript, an open source scripting interface to Panda, which was developed using bison and flex.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Application work</title>
<para>
I have been involved with the implementation of various Internet based systems for IPAustralia. IPAustralia is the Australian Patents, Trade Marks, and Designs offices.
</para>

<para>
I have developed several large scale PDF generation applications for IPAustralia. These were developed in C using a PDF generation API, and partially led to the development of Panda. These applications are capable of generating a 4,500 page PDF document in less than a minute on mid-range PC hardware running FreeBSD -- suitable for serving these documents on the fly to Internet customers. There is also a Windows NT version of one of these applications.
</para>

<para>
Development of a standard data loading infrastructure for IPAustralia capable of dealing with a large range of data input from CD ROMs, DVDs, tapes and scanning applications. This infrastructure is based on a UNIX server process, and is responsible for the loading of 99% of the corporate mission critical data.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Large scaling image processing and storage</title>
<para>
A selection of imaging applications which involve low level manipulation of image data. These have used libtiff, libjpeg and are starting to use libpng. Types of applications developed include image conversion, text insertion and data extraction applications. These applications are developed as needed internally by IPAustralia.
</para>

<para>
The ongoing maintenance and development of several corporate imaging systems, ranging for 9 million TIFF images, to 500,000 TIFF images, to 200,000 PDF documents.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Commercial software development of a leading Records Management and EDMS product</title>
<para>
This has included implementation of the ODMA specification, the parsing of Microsoft structured storage files, MFC user interfaces, document content searching and many other projects. Development was undertaken under win32 using COM and DCOM.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>System Testing</title>
<para>
I believe that proper testing of code before release is important. At one of my previous jobs (in the list below), I was responsible for the testing of a complex Internet application for Australia's largest telecommunications company. This involved the generation of use cases, test scripts, the planning of regression, unit and occasionally acceptance testing, and the implementation of this testing.
</para>

<para>
I am currently responsible for the acceptance testing for the Windows and Unix APIs for the most expensive piece of software my current employer has ever acquired -- an EDMS / Workflow suite from Objective Corporation.
</para>

<para>
My open source coding is also thoroughly tested. Panda, for instance, is put through a series of regression and common use tests before each release. Before a release is marked as stable, as series of unstable <quote>release candidates</quote> are also released to the wider developer community for testing. I am also working on implementation of a series of automated test cases, possibly using dejaGNU. I am also interested in implementing a series of random tests, where API calls are randomly made to check for errors in less commonly used execution paths. I regularly run code profilers and a debugging version of the memory management API to check for bottlenecks and memory leaks.
</para>

<para>
I have also liaised with the Quality Assurance team at TOWER Software on many occasions, and understand the issues involved with testing of complex commercial software packages.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Other</title>
<para>
I have also been involved with many other coding and systems administration projects, the above a merely some recent highlights. These include web based, Windows based, and UNIX based systems. I have also undertaken mainframe integration work. I have been involved with the support of various mission critical systems.
</para>
