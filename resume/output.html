><P
>The majority of my time is spent solving complex technical problems. These might be problems I have encountered myself while implementing a system, but also includes problems delegated from other members of the team. These problems have ranged from errors in complex pieces of code dealing with images at a bit level, network programming, system design and implementation, or solving problems related to Microsoft Windows development. I am also responsible for large amounts of development in areas which were previously poorly understood by TOWER.</P
