May 15 07:17:53 <ak> rmk: KVMs are problematic in general with the new code, mine needs a special option now.
May 15 07:18:06 <dwmw2> wli: note there's no locking around the {un,}map_vm_area() calls. You can allocate a VM range after someone else frees it, set up your ptes and then they tear theirs down...
May 15 07:18:13 <rmk> ak: this is more a timing issue, and there's a bug in there where a timeout never expires.

May 15 07:19:40 <Nemesis> parport has *always* been hairy

May 15 07:20:52 <akpm> next?
May 15 07:21:00 <akpm>  synaptic touchpad support.  There's a patch in -mm and someone emailed me today wrt forward-porting a spearate driver, so things are advancing there
May 15 07:21:01 <viro> akpm: IMO parport is more of "figure out what API changes are needed for its users, get them done ASAP, then fix generic layer at leisure"
May 15 07:21:43 <arjan> akpm: how's that different from the userspace tpconfig?
May 15 07:21:45 <Foske> akpm: did I miss ACPI already ?

May 15 07:22:56 <oxymoron> akpm: Just about any laptop touchpad..
May 15 07:23:15 <akpm> so does tpconfig mean that we don't need any kernel support for them?
May 15 07:23:16 <Foske> one of the mayor issues IMHO: If your kernel doesn't work: disable ACPI and try again...
May 15 07:23:43 <davej> how did extra driver support become a 'must-fix' item anyway ?
May 15 07:23:52 <ak> foske: same as with 2.4. nothing has changed.
May 15 07:23:57 <arjan> akpm: I think so; but I guess it's an "Ask Vojtech"
May 15 07:24:03 <ak> foske: nothing to be concerned about for the release.
May 15 07:24:04 <dwmw2> davej: we've taken to breaking the touchpad and clitmouse setups with the mouse probe

May 15 07:37:51 <arjan> would be nice to get at least the infrastructure to do it right in
May 15 07:37:54 <ak> everybody serious uses the external code
May 15 07:37:57 <rmk> ak: report known problems in my direction please.
May 15 07:38:00 <arjan> drivers can be fixed during 2.6.X itself
May 15 07:38:01 <akpm> ak: where does the working code come from?
May 15 07:38:02 <willy> i use the internal code
May 15 07:38:07 <ak> akpm: dmills
May 15 07:38:14 <akpm> dhinds?
May 15 07:38:15 <oxymoron> ak: Disagree.
May 15 07:38:19 <ak> erm hinds sorry
May 15 07:38:20 <gregkh> ak: I'm going to be working on the pci locking stuff.
May 15 07:38:32 <ak> all the distributions ship external
May 15 07:38:33 <gerrit_> seems like things that are broken in 2.4 and still broken in 2.6 should be on a different list from regressions in 2.6 and incomplete features in 2.6.
May 15 07:38:33 <dwmw2> pci locking is completely screwed. There's locking of sorts, but it's half-arsed
May 15 07:38:57 <ak> and external supports many more chipsets and drivers than internal
May 15 07:38:59 <arjan> ak: RH doesn't, Mandrake doesn't
May 15 07:39:04 <rmk> weren't we going to deprecate find_device and friends ?
May 15 07:39:06 <akpm> gerrit_: well if people aren't seriosuly hurting from them then they're not critical
May 15 07:39:08 <willy> gerrit: not entirely -- 2.6 may make these problems more likely to hit, and 2.6 is more capable so it'll be run on more boxes
May 15 07:39:13 <gregkh> gerrit_: no, pci locking still really needs to get fixed anyway.  it's much easier to do it on 2.5 than 2.4 because of the driver core now.
May 15 07:39:14 <oxymoron> arjan: Debian ships both, of course..

May 15 07:44:06 <davem> jsimmons slowly making progress on tis
May 15 07:44:16 <davem> I had to teach him how to maintain

May 15 07:44:26 <arjan> rare driver not compiling is not stopship
May 15 07:44:32 <viro> akpm: lots of serial drivers in drivers/char and arch/* do not compile either
May 15 07:44:33 <arjan> need a CONFIG_KNOWN_BROKEN
May 15 07:44:34 <cpufreak> ok
May 15 07:44:36 <cpufreak> that should be fixed

May 15 07:44:39 <cpufreak> sorry about that
May 15 07:44:39 <ak> fb really needs an better in kernel pageattr api
May 15 07:44:57 <gerrit_> CONFIG_KNOWN_BROKEN or at least an actively maintained list of working vs. broken
May 15 07:45:00 <ak> usually they're unusably slow on non x86 without write combining for the video buffer
May 15 07:45:01 <dwmw2> zaitcev: yes. Not sure if that's still the case. 
May 15 07:45:04 <akpm> davem: slowly.  Does James have help?  There's a Spanish-sounding guy who is very good, but I think he'd taken a month or two vacation.
May 15 07:45:16 <akpm> viro: ok, noted
May 15 07:45:19 <davej> there are also early-init problems with some of the framebuffers (like i810fb) too. Initialising fb from drivers/char/mem.c may not be the best thing.
May 15 07:45:21 <gerrit_> I keep seeing a lot of "lots of things are broken" but a list of what works AND what is broken would be good
May 15 07:45:31 <wli> part of that was my fault with the slabification
May 15 07:45:32 <davem> akpm: geert supposedly helps him

May 15 07:47:12 <davem> right
May 15 07:47:13 <jejb> What *needs* to be fixed
May 15 07:47:18 <oxymoron> If viro won't mention the locking nightmare, I will..

May 15 07:51:17 --- riel gives channel operator status to hanna
May 15 07:51:31 <jejb> feral also does endianness and sbus unlike the other non FC ones
May 15 07:51:34 <wli> qlogicisp.c falls over when you breathe on it for isp1020; IIRC other qlogic stuff is used mostly for feral wrt. IBM testing (you don't do perf runs on 32-bit cards on PAE boxen -- it's pointless)
May 15 07:51:43 <andmike> jejb: The feral does need some queue work on FC cards
May 15 07:52:03 <mbligh> wli, you obviously have dangerously bad breath ;-) Is pretty reliable for me

May 15 07:59:24 <akpm> I'll bug Stephen/tytso.  If they can flesh out the fix then chris of bzzz could code it
May 15 07:59:26 <akpm> I hope

May 15 07:59:57 <akpm> oxymoron: pretty good I think.
May 15 08:00:01 <-- Set has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
May 15 08:00:10 <tytso_> tytso: The only problem I know of is that the NFS patches you sent to Linus fix the flat dir->nfs problems, but

May 15 08:00:26 --> lochii (lochii@singularity.convergence.cx) has joined #lse
May 15 08:00:30 <akpm> ah, right.
May 15 08:00:33 <tytso_> out of order.  Nothing seems to break, and I haven't had time to work up the patch to fix that, if it needs fixing.
May 15 08:01:10 <tytso_> Once we get the OLS paper submitted, I'll get to work on that patch....
May 15 08:01:41 * corbet thinks "finish OLS paper" belongs on the must-fix list
May 15 08:01:49 <akpm> viro: fs/char_dev.c stuff noted
May 15 08:02:01 <akpm> - AIO/direct-IO writes can race with truncate and wreck filesystems.
May 15 08:02:11 <-- Steph has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
May 15 08:02:16 <akpm> that's possibly unfixable in the 2.6 context
May 15 08:02:18 <viro> akpm: yes, they can.
May 15 08:02:24 <wli> akpm: I just got sprayed with a list of like 10 aio bugs from internal stuff
May 15 08:02:36 <viro> akpm: it's a Don't Do It, Then issue
May 15 08:02:37 <arjan> akpm: sct fixed that for 2.4
May 15 08:02:42 <akpm> wimpy option is to disable AIO/DIO for S_ISREG unless special mount option is given
May 15 08:02:48 <oxymoron> viro: Seems like it.
May 15 08:03:02 <ak> viro: it's not limited to root
May 15 08:03:12 <akpm> arjan: no, this one is much more blatant than the 2.4 issues
May 15 08:03:46 <gerrit_> janetinc:  are you aware of the aio/dio/s_ISREG issues?  are you planning to work them at all perhaps with suparna?
May 15 08:03:48 <viro> ak: removal of O_DIRECT handling solves it neatly for me
May 15 08:03:50 <-- tcw (tcw@209.198.128.6) has left #lse
May 15 08:03:53 <akpm> we drop i_sem while IO is in progress.  It's a bit of a joke.

May 15 08:04:32 --> Steph (~sglass@pixpat.austin.ibm.com) has joined #lse
May 15 08:04:38 <janetinc> suparna and i can surely have a look at the aio/dio/s_ISREG issues

May 15 08:05:02 <willy> (presumably it's not an option because people have already published TPC numbers ;-)
May 15 08:05:06 <ak> arjan: because O_DIRECT is useful for a lot of things. you could make it root only, but that would be rather inconvenient 
May 15 08:05:07 <gerrit_> akpm:  lets avoid the wimpy option if janet can do something here.
May 15 08:05:10 <akpm> janetinc: I've discussed with suparna.  It's ugly.
May 15 08:05:11 <oxymoron> AIO should be fixable, O_DIRECT seems more troublesome.
May 15 08:05:29 <akpm> we also need to forward-port sct's fixes for regular O_DIRECT
May 15 08:05:51 <gerrit_> akpm:  is their a pointer to sct's patches somewhere?  on your list perhaps?
May 15 08:05:53 <sct> akpm: I think that should be fairly straightforward, I've been doing a bit more testing and they look OK.
May 15 08:05:59 <wli> out of curiosity, is there any intention to merge the rest of aio? AIUI there's some large fraction of the actual async semantics that never hit the tree.
May 15 08:06:23 <sct> gerrit_: Not yet.  There are some security implications.
May 15 08:06:26 <jejb> Doesn't full AIO depend on error stacks which we don't have?
May 15 08:06:27 <wli> (it sounds doubtful given the current state of affairs)
May 15 08:06:31 <akpm> wli: I need to review suparna's stuff
May 15 08:06:49 <oxymoron> wli: Linus was talking about a fairly major AIO-centric revamp when this last came up..
May 15 08:06:51 <akpm> wli: and run it by bcrl
May 15 08:06:53 <wli> jejb: worktodos and/or equivalents? yes
May 15 08:07:02 <willy> akpm: suparna has major doubts about the last set of patches she sent
May 15 08:07:10 <gerrit_> btw, anyone who has test cases that break aio/dio/etc. should submit them to LTP
May 15 08:07:13 <akpm> willy: of what nature?
May 15 08:07:24 <jejb> wli: ability to direct the driver error handlers is what I mean (i.e. don't retry 15 times etc.)
May 15 08:07:32 <willy> akpm: mostly "better ways to do stuff", I think.
May 15 08:07:54 <akpm> willy: ah.  I probably scared her ;)
May 15 08:08:02 <sct> I just got back from a debate this evening and am off to bed shortly --- arjan said there was O_DIRECT stuff going on.
May 15 08:08:04 <wli> jejb: AFAIK we have 0 of that and the 2.4.x stuff didn't either
May 15 08:08:12 <akpm> willy: her architecture leverages existing error propagation.  It's workable.
May 15 08:08:12 <sct> Anything I need to mention before I disappear?
May 15 08:08:16 <jejb> wli:  that's why I said *full*
May 15 08:08:31 <jejb> It also applies to layerd drivers (like md)
May 15 08:08:32 <gerrit_> sct:  if you need help testing with that stuff, let janetmor@us.ibm.com or suparna know - we'll help
May 15 08:08:33 <wli> sct: basically aio/dio writes race w/truncate and someone said you had s fix somewhere
May 15 08:08:37 <akpm> sct: lock_journal() stinks ;)
May 15 08:08:47 <sct> akpm: We know that. :)
May 15 08:09:02 <sct> wli: aio isn't the problem, it's buffered/direct races which hurt.
May 15 08:09:13 <akpm> bzzz's stuff is in my intray.  big.
May 15 08:09:20 <wli> sct: okay so you know what's going on then?
May 15 08:09:51 <akpm> wli: the stuff sct is working on is subtle.  AIO/DIO is a great big clanger.
May 15 08:09:56 <willy> would lock_journal() suck less if we had spin-then-sleep semaphores?
May 15 08:10:10 <akpm> willy: it might, yes.  Could be fun to play with
May 15 08:10:12 <riel> would it be possible to simply have truncate() fail while any process has the file open with O_DIRECT ?
May 15 08:10:12 <wli> This vaguely sounds like the stuff has owners & forward progress.
May 15 08:10:24 <akpm> wli: yup
May 15 08:10:27 <akpm> next....
May 15 08:10:29 <akpm> devfs!
May 15 08:10:32 <viro> riel: that's too ugly
May 15 08:10:37 <tytso_> move to terminate...
May 15 08:10:44 <viro> akpm: er. above comment applies

May 15 08:10:55 <viro> tytso: let hch do it
May 15 08:10:58 <arjan> isn't it nearly gone alreayd?

May 15 08:11:18 <akpm> the plan there (I hope) is to rip the core and put in smalldevfs

May 15 08:11:55 <riel> I'm sure devfs will turn out nicely with hch and viro looking after it
May 15 08:12:09 <akpm> anything else under fs/?
May 15 08:12:19 <green> reiserfs? ;)
May 15 08:12:23 <wli> akpm: hugetlbfs sucking on non-x86

May 15 08:12:34 <-- Foske has quit (Quit: using sirc version 2.211+KSIRC/1.2.4)
May 15 08:12:43 <viro> green: tail-related stuff
May 15 08:12:44 <green> what's up with that reiserfs_read_pages patch that I believe sits in -mm?
May 15 08:12:54 <akpm> wli: bugzilla stuff I think.  
May 15 08:12:56 <viro> green: IIRC, there was some mess going on
May 15 08:12:56 <green> viro: Hm, what's wrong with tail related stuff?
May 15 08:13:14 <viro> green: I'll need to look through archives - might've been fixed
May 15 08:13:15 <green> viro: any info/testcases? this is first time I hear about it
May 15 08:13:19 <wli> akpm: sparc64 is gross negligence + zero hardware =(
May 15 08:13:44 <davem> wli: Be nice if there was a testsuite somewhere, then I might work on it
May 15 08:13:54 <davem> wli: otherwise I'm -ENORACLE
May 15 08:14:01 <ak> davem: it's easy to test.
May 15 08:14:11 <davem> ak: I don't want to have to code up test programs
May 15 08:14:13 <green> also what's general opinion on st.blk_sizr increase, I wonder? (besides some broken applications breaking)?
May 15 08:14:15 <davej> wli: btw, shouldn't hugetlbfs fail to mount if the cpu doesn't support large pages?
May 15 08:14:16 <wli> davem: I'll bounce some stuff your way, then.
May 15 08:14:20 <davem> wli: cool
May 15 08:14:22 <ak> davem: just hack up the ltp shm testcases a bit
May 15 08:14:41 <davem> davej: sparc64 supprots it, but I haven't maintained the code at all
May 15 08:14:45 <wli> davej: oh boy, sounds like a bogon
May 15 08:14:51 <davej> davem: yah, different issue..
May 15 08:14:55 <akpm> green: that patch has been in -mm for ages, but I'm wobbly about the st_blocksize thing.
May 15 08:15:05 <davej> wli: not sure if that got fixed, but it was the case a while back
May 15 08:15:13 <davem> anything else?
May 15 08:15:22 <ak> green: "some" is good. everybody using old bsd db breaks.
May 15 08:15:27 <wli> I'm done with fs/
May 15 08:15:37 <riel> how is ACL/EA stuff looking in 2.5 ?
May 15 08:15:40 <green> akpm: Hans seems to strongly want it. I apoke with Sleepycat and they said that they limit their IO window to 16k anyway. kmail issue is fixed, what's left?
May 15 08:15:43 <bzzz> akpm: probably, fast EA for ext3?
May 15 08:15:58 <akpm> green: but you guys own it.  If you want to push ahead, and we have a mount option to turn it off, then let's do it.
May 15 08:16:13 <-- gregg_it has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
May 15 08:16:19 <green> akpm: ok, let's hope Linus will accept it then, I'll try to push it again tomorrow
May 15 08:16:32 <akpm> bzzz: I'm an EA ignoramus.  I don't know if anyone is using it much, but the code has had decent testing in 2.4 I believe
May 15 08:16:41 <akpm> green: is -mm uptodate?
May 15 08:16:51 <oxymoron> I don't think EA/ACL qualifies as must-fix at this point.
May 15 08:16:52 <viro> akpm: there is some generic stuff for namei/namespace/super, but that's a slow-merge and can go in 2.6 just fine
May 15 08:17:01 <davej> green: is Hans still hoping for inclusion of reiser4 for 2.6 ?
May 15 08:17:03 <sct> akpm: It has, there's a fair following of AG's patches on 2.4
May 15 08:17:05 <green> akpm: Should be, I made exactly zero changes on top of what you have in -mm
May 15 08:17:07 --> pzb (~pzb@peabody.ximian.com) has joined #lse
May 15 08:17:13 <viro> davej: *what*?
May 15 08:17:14 <green> davej: Yes, I think he does
May 15 08:17:27 <davej> that seems to have gone quiet over the last months
May 15 08:17:30 <oxymoron> 2.6.1, perhaps..
May 15 08:17:35 <akpm> green: OK, please check it over, let me know and I'll send it on
May 15 08:17:50 <green> davej: He thinks he have some secret agreement with Linus so that even if reiser4 is late for 2.6.0, it may get in later as it happened with reiserfs
May 15 08:17:58 <green> akpm: Ok
May 15 08:18:15 <akpm> kernel/
May 15 08:18:21 <akpm> O(1) scheduler starvation, poor behaviour seems unresolved.
May 15 08:18:24 <oxymoron> green: Hopefully Linus will hand over 2.6 at .0 this time around..
May 15 08:18:30 <davej> green: difference being lots of people were using old reiser before the merge already due to distros merging it
May 15 08:18:34 <nevdull> akpm: is Jens on?
May 15 08:18:36 <arjan> akpm: is that sched_yield() stuff?
May 15 08:18:37 <willy> openmp seems to be a good trigger
May 15 08:18:41 <akpm> nevdull: nope
May 15 08:18:45 <arjan> willy: openmp is sched_yield() crap
May 15 08:18:49 <arjan> willy: intel bogon code
May 15 08:18:50 <mbligh> akpm: wasn't that just Linus' patch?
May 15 08:19:03 <arjan> willy: they ought to use cpu binding and suddenly all is well
May 15 08:19:13 <nevdull> if this is the sched_yield stuff again, it shouldn't hold up.  But I think we need to know how it "still doesn't feel as good".
May 15 08:19:17 <akpm> what's openmp?
May 15 08:19:19 <green> davej: well, I don't know what to say on this then ;)
May 15 08:19:26 <oxymoron> mbligh: Linus' patch was addressing a problem that's still there without the patch..
May 15 08:19:27 <willy> akpm: like PVM, aiui
May 15 08:19:30 <arjan> akpm: intel fortran lib
May 15 08:19:38 <akpm> it has a scheduler problem?
May 15 08:19:40 <drepper> akpm: there are at least two big problems with the interaction between futex and O(1).  Ingo has already patches.  But we need much more testing on big boxes.  Only 4p+ machines have problems
May 15 08:19:41 <arjan> akpm: they try to parallel compute 
May 15 08:19:51 <arjan> akpm: it calls sched_yield() in a tight loop in a spinlock like thing
May 15 08:20:09 <wli> drepper: give me something to test
May 15 08:20:10 <akpm> david m-t has said he's seen significant problems with compute loads too.  He'll be preparing a report next week
May 15 08:20:11 <arjan> akpm: O(1) scheduler refuses to move 1 of them to the second cpu if you have 2 threads in contention
May 15 08:20:19 <arjan> akpm: and then Intel gets upset about that
May 15 08:20:19 <mbligh> drepper: IBM has plenty of big boxes we can help you with ;-)
May 15 08:20:31 <gerrit_> akpm:  I have a lot of data that suggests that HT scheduling stinks - e.g. loss of performance with HT on...
May 15 08:20:42 <arjan> akpm: davidmt bug is the same openmp issue
May 15 08:20:43 <gerrit_> akpm:  but I don't think it is stuff to hold the freeze.  not a functional issue
May 15 08:20:48 <willy> gerrit: well that could be a hardware problem too
May 15 08:20:51 <davej> gerrit_: horses for courses... some loads its a win, some a lose.

May 15 08:20:57 <willy> arjan: no, he's got two issues
May 15 08:20:59 <nevdull> find_busiest_queue has rounding errors due to the integer arithmetic. There are discontinuities in its decisions about where to balance.
May 15 08:21:00 <wli> major performance target
May 15 08:21:05 <willy> one's openmp, the other's something else
May 15 08:21:07 <gerrit_> willy:  HT is a hardware problem.
May 15 08:21:09 <randy> gerrit_: are those just degenerate cases (known) or not?
May 15 08:21:10 <arjan> willy: ok
May 15 08:21:27 <drepper> wli: mbligh: just get rhl9 and compile glibc with nptl.  there are several test programs aavailable.  I'd suggest joining the nptl mailing list
May 15 08:21:27 <mbligh> nevdull: I had a fix for that somewhere
May 15 08:21:36 <gerrit_> davej:  we have MS benchmarks and linux benchmarks on identical hardware.  MS shows a 20-30% gain, linux shows a degredation.
May 15 08:21:43 <oxymoron> akpm: Do we still have the 'wiggling a window makes X go non-interactive' bug?
May 15 08:21:50 <nevdull> mbligh: it's not hard to fix.  But it's still in the standard code.
May 15 08:21:58 <davej> gerrit_: which benchmark ?
May 15 08:22:04 <akpm> gerrit_: I have the impression that you have a lot of half-timers on the scheduler.  Is there a particular owner there who can help to push things along?
May 15 08:22:05 <gerrit_> davej:  tpc-h
May 15 08:22:12 <gerrit_> davej:  and I think specjbb (java)
May 15 08:22:13 <dhansen> davej: Specjbb too
May 15 08:22:18 <akpm> oxymoron: it's much improved
May 15 08:22:21 <arjan> gerrit_: oracle is a cache hog; mssequelsewer isn't
May 15 08:22:29 <mbligh> nevdull, just shift the divisors onto the other side of the eqn IIRC
May 15 08:22:31 <arjan> gerrit_: HT sucks for cache hogs, you trash the other cpu's cache too
May 15 08:22:35 <gerrit_> akpm:  nevdull is our focal point, andrew theurer hacks a bit as well
May 15 08:22:41 <nevdull> akpm: I've heard one significant thing so far:  Ingo has patches.  Seems like we should try those before spending a lot of cycles on this.
May 15 08:22:43 <-- mnc has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
May 15 08:22:51 <gerrit_> arjan:  yep - well aware, and DB2 was on MS and Linux...
May 15 08:22:58 <wli> drepper: we've got dedicated scheduler-interested ppl (e.g. nevdull, habanero, hubertus) we're probably better sharing our machines with to get you runtime, I'll see what I can do to get them plugged in
May 15 08:23:00 <gerrit_> same app, radically different performance
May 15 08:23:20 <arjan> gerrit_: same threading model ?
May 15 08:23:49 <gerrit_> arjan:  hard to know - in theory yes, but in practice, theres a lot of arch specific code in the database
May 15 08:24:08 <gerrit_> arjan:  hard to weed out the app differences - which is part of why it is taking so long.
May 15 08:24:18 <gerrit_> arjan:  ditto on java related benchmarks.
May 15 08:24:32 <ak> the NUMA scheduling will also need a lot of work, but that's a different issue (and no showstopper for release)
May 15 08:24:48 <nevdull> ak: agreed.  NUMA needs work but need not hold up 2.6.
May 15 08:24:49 <wli> nevdull: I'm concerned there are issues beyond load balancing going on. The queueing metrics I've collected appear to show some large discrepancies in scheduling latencies and waiting time on UP
May 15 08:25:20 <gerrit_> and again, I don't think the HT stuff holds 2.6 - but it does need some better understanding and we are looking for that.
May 15 08:25:21 <nevdull> Ok, those would be useful to go over.
May 15 08:25:29 <akpm> hanna: admin: we're 33% of the way through.  How about we go through to the end of the "bugs" list, do features next time?
May 15 08:25:34 --- riel is now known as unriel
May 15 08:25:37 <gerrit_> and NUMA is likely to be a distro value add item across the board...
May 15 08:25:46 <hanna> akpm sounds good. next week same time and day?
May 15 08:25:57 <gerrit_> if it makes 2.6.XX, it will have to be mostly arch independent.
May 15 08:26:08 <akpm> hanna: we cn wor that out later.  There's still 30-60 minutes worth today.
May 15 08:26:26 <akpm> next?
May 15 08:26:28 <ak> gerrit: one issue is that there is quite different NUMA. k8 style NUMA vs 2/4 cpus per node big iron numa
May 15 08:26:38 <ak> gerrit: they need different strategies
May 15 08:26:44 <mbligh> nevdull / ak: as long as we can turn it off (it's now a separate config option), I don't see it's a regression from 2.4 ;-)
May 15 08:26:54 <davem> akpm: I also have to leave soon, need to hit net soonish :)

May 15 08:28:36 <randy> davem which is the TCP hang issue?
May 15 08:28:42 <davem> Last one in net/
May 15 08:28:43 <ak> davem: but it won't need driver changes I hope?

May 15 08:29:01 <ak> TCP_CORK is not a showstopper ;)

May 15 08:29:29 <davej_> thats under nfs

May 15 08:30:06 <davem> randy: yep
May 15 08:30:10 <akpm> I suspect my MAP_SHARED test will nuke nfs again.  Need to retest.  I pretty much know what to do there.  That's just a bug tho
May 15 08:30:15 <ak> also soft needs to be fixed - there are quite a lot of uninterruptible waits in sunrpc/nfs
May 15 08:30:21 <viro> davem: per-interface sysctls are FUBAR, but that's not new
May 15 08:30:24 <ak> (not a showstopper of course)
May 15 08:30:29 <davem> viro: which ones?
May 15 08:30:56 <viro> davem: entire bunch - if they disappear on ifdown, you have trouble

May 15 08:32:37 <davem> akpm: there was no resolution

May 15 08:34:44 <akpm> Alan: 32bit uid support is *still* broken for process accounting.
May 15 08:34:49 <akpm> Create a 32bit uid, turn accounting on.  Shock horror it doesn't work
May 15 08:34:50 <akpm>   because the field is 16bit.  We need an acct structure flag day for 2.6
May 15 08:34:50 <akpm>   IMHO
May 15 08:35:02 <ak> akpm: does anybody still use process accounting ?
May 15 08:35:05 <akpm> anyone here understand this?
May 15 08:35:10 <viro> akpm: sure
May 15 08:35:12 <wli> yes
May 15 08:35:21 <gerrit_> sure, but who really uses process accounting?
May 15 08:35:37 <ak> the people who do supercomputer accounting have more complex patches anyways
May 15 08:35:37 <viro> akpm: the record is fixed-format.
May 15 08:35:42 <viro> akpm: binary
May 15 08:35:44 <oxymoron> Paranoid folks too.
May 15 08:35:54 <viro> akpm: with narrow field for UID
May 15 08:36:05 <tytso_> Well, if no one uses it, then a flag day switch of the structure before 2.6.0 ships should be easy.
May 15 08:36:12 <viro> akpm: fix: change the format
May 15 08:36:13 <arjan> akpm: yes
May 15 08:36:26 <arjan> akpm: afaik there's 16 bits of spare change in the records
May 15 08:36:30 <viro> akpm: will require change of sa(8)
May 15 08:36:31 <arjan> akpm: so not unfixable
May 15 08:36:44 <arjan> viro: are you sure? I thought there was some spare space in that struct

May 15 08:38:38 <arjan> viro: ok so fixable, not pretty but fixable
May 15 08:38:57 <akpm> oxymoron: well if we need to change API we'd better do it soon and loudly.

May 15 08:41:08 * willy moves it be called GFP_4G
May 15 08:41:14 <jejb> wli: can be done with minor header tweaking.  Needed for IA64 noiommu
May 15 08:41:30 <akpm> jejb: that's a separate zone.  If we really want it, then yeah, who has patch?
May 15 08:41:35 <zaitcev> s390x needs 2GB limits
May 15 08:41:45 <jejb> akpm: can be implemented in current zone
May 15 08:41:45 <arjan> jejb: only if you don't merge the real ia64 noiommu fix
May 15 08:41:50 <zaitcev> Not 4, mind
May 15 08:41:53 <arjan> well
May 15 08:41:59 <arjan> we need an allocator that takes a bitmask
May 15 08:42:06 <arjan> also for 31 bit PCI devices
May 15 08:42:13 <arjan> as low level primitive
May 15 08:42:18 <wli> okay then let's take this one to another forum?
May 15 08:42:21 <zaitcev> Currently they just defined GFP_DMA to be 31 bit long
May 15 08:42:23 <jejb> arjan: so kmalloc_mask() instead.  That's invasive
May 15 08:42:24 <zaitcev> Sorry
May 15 08:42:48 <-- arjan has quit (Quit: sleeptime for real)
May 15 08:42:51 <willy> zaitcev: right, and ia64 defines GFP_DMA to be anything under 4GB
May 15 08:43:18 <wli> well we don't even agree on strategy here so let's make up our minds some other time
May 15 08:43:35 <akpm> I'll poke the stakeholders, see if we can work out what we want to do
May 15 08:43:47 <akpm> modules
May 15 08:44:04 <akpm> everything I have here seems to be under control.
May 15 08:44:06 <jejb> OK.  GFP_DMA32 is the quick fix. kmalloc_mask() is better but more difficult
May 15 08:44:21 <willy> without rusty here, no point in discussing modules
May 15 08:44:36 <acme> akpm:  have you seen DaveM's take on modules for complex subsystems like IPv6 and IPv4? 
May 15 08:44:37 --> davidvh (~David@dhcp14096.mccollum.fsu.edu) has joined #lse
May 15 08:44:42 <viro> willy: yup
May 15 08:44:48 <hanna> maybe next call will be earlier so europeans/aussies can make it..
May 15 08:44:50 <akpm> but there are issues wrt alleged overall loss of functionality cmpared to 2.4..
May 15 08:44:53 <acme> IPv4 is not an issue right now, its not modular anyway
May 15 08:45:05 <akpm> acme: yes, dave mentioned two-stage unload
May 15 08:45:20 <akpm> next?
May 15 08:45:21 <acme> but IPv6 has just too many dinamicly allocated structs to do tons of __module_get/put
May 15 08:45:37 <acme> I'll get his unpublished doc on modules and post here
May 15 08:45:38 <ak> not unloading ipv6 would also be no regression - it is not unloadable in 2.4
May 15 08:45:46 <akpm> waht ak said.
May 15 08:45:54 <acme> ak:  agreed
May 15 08:46:08 <akpm> net/*/netfilter/
May 15 08:46:11 <ak> just bridge etc.but these can be made ununloadable too
May 15 08:46:16 <willy> akpm: also rusty
May 15 08:46:17 <akpm> that's rusty stuff, under control.
May 15 08:46:22 <akpm> sound/
May 15 08:46:30 <phillips> the original time is ok for europe, except 9 to 5ers
May 15 08:46:36 <akpm> rmk: several OSS drivers for SA11xx-based hardware in need of
May 15 08:46:36 <akpm>   ALSA-ification and L3 bus support code for these.
May 15 08:46:42 <phillips> aussies can make it if they get up early
May 15 08:46:47 <davej_> lots of OSS drivers still lacking fixes from 2.4
May 15 08:47:01 <akpm> davej_: does that have an owner?
May 15 08:47:02 <willy> one plan i heard was to kill OSS for 2.6
May 15 08:47:13 <acme> I've heard that as well
May 15 08:47:15 <davej_> Adam Belay was supposed to be scooping them up, but I've not seen anything from him
May 15 08:47:15 <rmk> more drivers stuff from me... the oss drivers can't go in as is because it seems that the OSS bits seem to use virt_to_bus
May 15 08:47:19 <wli> willy: is there functionality loss implied?
May 15 08:47:24 <davej_> willy: last I heard was 'some of it.. maybe'
May 15 08:47:28 <acme> not sure if alsa replaces everything in OSS tho
May 15 08:47:32 <-- Astro has quit (Quit: The Well Of Wishes awaits in Crypt Of Decay...)
May 15 08:47:47 <oxymoron> There's some OSS->Alsa breakage, yes.
May 15 08:47:50 <davej_> killing it off completley is probably 2.7 material
May 15 08:47:58 <acme> davej_:  agreed
May 15 08:48:07 <rmk> so basically for arm everything has to be alsa.

May 15 08:49:02 <akpm> Lots of 2.4 fixes including some security are not in 2.5
May 15 08:49:11 <akpm> main problem: how do we find them again?
May 15 08:49:20 <davej_> I've got a bunch of those pending cleaning up/rediffing
May 15 08:49:23 <davej_> Alan also has a bunch
May 15 08:49:29 <ak> akpm: HZ=1000 :- it made the timer handler bugs with skipping jiffies worsep
May 15 08:49:37 <akpm> ok
May 15 08:49:40 <badari>  akpm: I asked Dipankar to follow up
May 15 08:49:47 <davej_> going through the old 2.4 commit logs could be worthwhile for someone with too much time on their hands
May 15 08:49:48 <akpm> ak: what's the fix for that
May 15 08:49:49 <akpm> ?
May 15 08:50:06 --- randy is now known as randy_gone
May 15 08:50:18 <ak> akpm: implement a PLL for the timer interrupt (arjan was talking about that)
May 15 08:50:24 <akpm> ak: does the lost_tick stuff help?
May 15 08:50:27 <wli> PLL?
May 15 08:50:33 <willy> Phase Locked Loop
May 15 08:50:35 <oxymoron> wli: phase locked loop
May 15 08:50:37 <ak> or lower HZ again
May 15 08:50:44 <ak> akpm: only for a single lost tick
May 15 08:50:55 <oxymoron> ak: Quick summary of problem again?
May 15 08:50:56 <akpm> ak: what is the cause?
May 15 08:51:05 <ak> akpm: ACPI or SMM code
May 15 08:51:18 <ak> they sometimes add quite long delays with interrupts off
May 15 08:51:27 <oxymoron> ak: Missing expiry of timers?
May 15 08:51:34 <willy> ACPI is fixable ... SMM less so
May 15 08:51:48 <ak> oxymoron: no gettimeofday becomes non monotonous, which breaks applications
May 15 08:52:27 <oxymoron> ak: Ahh..
May 15 08:52:27 <akpm> hmm, I don't see this being fixed.
May 15 08:52:47 <willy> ia64 has a mechanism for ensuring that gettimeofday is monotonous
May 15 08:52:49 <ak> akpm: or add hack: single lock for gettimeofday that stops it going backwards
May 15 08:52:57 <-- Lucifair (~luism@212.202.185.200) has left #lse (Client exiting)
May 15 08:53:03 <ak> akpm: but it will cost you because gettimeofday is time critical
May 15 08:53:06 <willy> i'm not sure people would like it, it involves a cmpxchg

May 15 08:53:39 <-- rz has quit (Quit: Client exiting)
May 15 08:53:43 <ak> but x86-64 has it as vsyscall which cannot do locks 
May 15 08:53:49 <badari> akpm: hollisb is working on these
May 15 08:54:10 <oxymoron> ak: Can we reduce the externally visible time resolution?
May 15 08:54:19 <phillips> I'd like to see 2.6.0 guarantee monotonic gettimeofday
May 15 08:54:25 <willy> ak: but you can loop till successful like ia64 does
May 15 08:54:46 <ak> willy: no, vsyscalls cannot update global state
May 15 08:55:31 <akpm> ak: do you think you can come up with a plan for tfixing his?  John Stultz may be able to help out.
May 15 08:55:45 * jstultz_ wakes up
May 15 08:55:53 <ak> akpm: i don't have bandwidth to work on it, sorry.
May 15 08:55:59 <ak> just wanted to mention the problem
May 15 08:56:12 <akpm> ak: as in: suggest a fix, that's all.
May 15 08:56:15 <gerrit_> hbaum, jstultz: does jstultz have bandwidth to dedicate to this?
May 15 08:56:20 <ak> akpm: talk to arjan
May 15 08:56:30 <ak> he had some ideas
May 15 08:56:56 * akpm nominates jstultz_ ;)
May 15 08:57:10 <acme> ok, found: netdev TODO list made by DaveM and with help from a bunch of people: http://pizda.ninka.net/~davem/netdev.html
May 15 08:57:21 <akpm> movin on, last item..
May 15 08:57:22 <gerrit_> akpm: jstultz it is - we'll have to work out details
May 15 08:57:35 <jstultz_> noted.
May 15 08:57:35 <akpm> 64-bit dev_t
May 15 08:57:41 <hbaum_> gerrit_: yep jstultz can find the time
May 15 08:57:56 <viro> akpm: we need to sort the mess in cdev out before that
May 15 08:58:11 <viro> akpm: cdev-cidr will do that
May 15 08:58:13 <aeb> Things are in good shape, I think
May 15 08:58:22 <viro> aeb: like hell they are
May 15 08:58:33 <aeb> Independent of what happens in cdev
May 15 08:58:48 <viro> akpm: we _really_ need to get sane API for device number allocation and get it right
May 15 08:58:57 <viro> akpm: and that's more serious than cdev
May 15 08:59:08 <viro> akpm: what we have now is a joke
May 15 08:59:31 <aeb> We have nothing at all
May 15 08:59:37 <akpm> viro: can that work be decoupled from simply making dev_t wider to userspace?
May 15 08:59:54 <akpm> viro: because it'll take time to weed out remaining broken userspace apps
May 15 09:00:05 <akpm> nice to do that in parallel with cdev rework
May 15 09:00:13 <viro> akpm: cdev is not a problem
May 15 09:00:20 <gerrit_> viro:  getting work aka badari's for 5000 devices on IA32 is a major thing for IBM across the board and also for oracle.
May 15 09:00:42 <viro> akpm: however, /proc/devices changes will be needed
May 15 09:00:54 <viro> akpm: and we'd better get that stuff right.
May 15 09:00:56 <gerrit_> viro:  we are highly motivated to "do the right thing" for 2.6
May 15 09:01:11 <wli> gerrit: IMHO the fix for that is probably not 2.6 mergeable (if mergeable at all)
May 15 09:01:19 <viro> wli: ?
May 15 09:01:19 <gerrit_> viro:  if there are things we need to do to get it right, give us pointers
May 15 09:01:20 <wli> gerrit: I've outlined what it is, though.
May 15 09:01:37 <aeb> But tThere is no need to use /proc/devices for anything with major > 255
May 15 09:01:57 <-- colpatch has quit (Quit: Client Exiting)
May 15 09:02:04 <wli> viro: stashing info to re-instantiate what are currently pinned dentries/inodes somewhere besides lowmem
May 15 09:02:11 <oxymoron> proc/devices must continue to exist for everything that used it in 2.4.
May 15 09:02:25 <viro> oxymoron: I'm not sure
May 15 09:02:36 <wli> viro: I'd need a serious sit-down just to work out the fs mechanics to get it plausible, much less working, and it's guaranteed the world will hate it.
May 15 09:02:45 <aeb> I gave a list of users of /proc/devices earlier today or yesterday 
May 15 09:02:59 --> tridge (~tridge@fjall.tridgell.net) has joined #lse
May 15 09:03:04 <oxymoron> aeb: In response to hch? Saw that..
May 15 09:03:13 <viro> oxymoron: it's becoming a PITA and it's not about to get prettier
May 15 09:03:52 <viro> oxymoron: we can leave it as-is, but that means a massive kludge existing only to keep /proc/devices alive
May 15 09:04:01 <viro> oxymoron: really massive kludge
May 15 09:04:38 <akpm> I'm confused
May 15 09:04:38 <viro> akpm: OK
May 15 09:05:06 <viro> akpm: let me put it that way: getting syscall boundary into sane shape wrt 64bit dev_t is easy
May 15 09:05:08 <PugMajere> can /proc/devices, or an equivalent file be created with some fancy hooks using /sbin/hotplug and converting /proc/devices into a symlink to somewhere else?
May 15 09:05:10 <wli> viro: er, sorry if I wasn't clear on the issue, the dentry cache / inode cache lowmem hit from sysfs et al with insane numbers of devices is crippling to the PAE boxen (space behavior of various things was pretty well analyzed and the 2 or 3 above this were already knocked out of the running). i.e. something nobody (except PAE system vendors) even wants fixed.
May 15 09:05:32 <viro> akpm: the stuff that bites is
May 15 09:05:58 <viro> a) filesystems that keep dev_t of external log - with not enough width
May 15 09:06:00 <oxymoron> viro: Do you have a plan re legacy device numbering? 
May 15 09:06:05 <viro> b) ioctls
May 15 09:06:11 <viro> oxymoron: ?
May 15 09:06:18 <akpm> wli: we need to revisit that.  Linus was totally against dopey icache/dcaceh hacks, and when you do the numbers, the VFS cache mem usage wasn't _taht_ bad.  It was mainly pinned requests and stuff.
May 15 09:06:20 <viro> oxymoron: leave it as-is, obviously
May 15 09:06:41 <akpm> viro: I thought aeb had basically fixed the ioctls?
May 15 09:06:44 <oxymoron> viro: I think we only care about /proc/devices for stuff that -had- an 8:8 number.
May 15 09:07:17 <viro> akpm: IOW, when foo_bar_we_are_special_ioctl_wank_wank_wank() passes int and casts it to dev_t - we got a problem
May 15 09:07:29 <viro> akpm: there are remaining instances
May 15 09:07:31 <wli> akpm: If it turns out to be necessary I'll probably be on the hook for it, but it's probably just not for mainline.
May 15 09:07:32 <akpm> viro: ext3 external journal we can just break.  it's a plaything, not serious feature.
May 15 09:08:14 <tytso_> akpm: yes, no one should be using it in production.
May 15 09:08:19 <viro> akpm: aeb had fixed some, but it's nowhere near completeness
May 15 09:08:30 <akpm> viro: if we merge up the minimal 64-bit patch then those things will be noticed sooner, won't they?
May 15 09:08:53 <viro> akpm: not sure
May 15 09:09:03 --> niemeyer (~niemeyer@200.103.138.210) has joined #lse
May 15 09:09:07 <viro> akpm: sorry - back in a couple of minutes (RL)
May 15 09:09:08 <aeb> "noticed" is not my style
May 15 09:09:15 <akpm> viro: aeb was reviewing hundreds of ioctls
May 15 09:09:18 <aeb> things must be provably correct
May 15 09:09:36 <tytso_> akpm: Especially if we alias the legacy devices at 0xFFFFabcd :-)
May 15 09:09:49 --> yg_home (~yusufg@cm61-10-95-8.hkcable.com.hk) has joined #lse
May 15 09:09:56 <akpm> aeb: how far along is that review?
May 15 09:10:02 <oxymoron> tytso: Interesting. Breaks everything, but interesting.
May 15 09:10:27 <aeb> I think I did two-thirds or so, but was unsure how things
May 15 09:10:35 <aeb> would go now that viro is back
May 15 09:10:47 <tytso_> oxymoron: might as well find them now
May 15 09:10:52 * viro returns
May 15 09:10:56 <-- ak has quit (Quit: using sirc version 2.151+ssfe)
May 15 09:11:03 <aeb> However, I am happy to see that everybody seems to agree what to do at the syscall boundary
May 15 09:11:41 <akpm> so suppose we were to jsut merge up the 64-bit patches from -mm.  What's bad about that idea?
May 15 09:11:54 <viro> akpm: it's a matter of grep, actually - most of uses of dev_t and kdev_t are gone, so it's not too hard to find the rest
May 15 09:12:07 <-- zaitcev has quit (Quit: bye bye)
May 15 09:12:07 <viro> akpm: mail them to me, OK?
May 15 09:12:15 <akpm> viro: sure will.
May 15 09:12:48 <akpm> viro: and it sounds like the cdev work, device number allocation, etc is ongoing non-showstopper?  
May 15 09:13:12 <viro> akpm: cdev work is ongoing and it must be done before 2.6
May 15 09:13:22 <viro> akpm: at least on the upper levels
May 15 09:13:37 <akpm> viro: what are you up to there?
May 15 09:13:39 <gerrit_> viro:  is this a multi-month task, though?  or is there any chance it'll be done in a month or so?
May 15 09:14:01 <oxymoron> gerrit: Seems unlikely with the tty stuff in addition..
May 15 09:14:13 <-- markh has quit (Quit: Client Exiting)
May 15 09:14:24 <gerrit_> oxymoron:  yeah, I'm adding in my head, hoping the close down is sooner rather than later...
May 15 09:14:28 --> ajax (~jakorty@208.248.32.211) has joined #lse
May 15 09:14:29 <viro> akpm: main group is pretty stable and I hope to feed it to Linus RSN
May 15 09:14:47 <viro> akpm: that's cdev-cidr and ->i_cdev/->i_cindex stuff
May 15 09:15:24 <akpm> ok, thanks.
May 15 09:15:40 <viro> akpm: after that we need to fix refcounting for tty_driver (oopsable race, must fix anyway, hopefully about a week until it's merged)
May 15 09:16:08 <akpm> anyone else have anything we need to talk about today?
May 15 09:16:08 <viro> akpm: then we can do tty/misc/upper levels of sound and hopefully upper level of USB
May 15 09:16:18 <wli> viro: is there room for helpers in the equation? You mentioned backports/etc. would be needed?
May 15 09:16:18 <-- ajax has quit (Client Quit)
May 15 09:16:42 <viro> wli: see above - after the first two parts are in, it branches
May 15 09:17:01 <viro> wli: IOW, propagation into subsystems is independent
May 15 09:17:29 <oxymoron> wli: Backports for tty fixes, yes. 
May 15 09:17:39 <-- tridge has quit (Quit: Client exiting)
May 15 09:17:47 <viro> akpm: USB is a place where we _really_ need to deal with dynamic allocation of device numbers
May 15 09:17:50 <wli> viro: That sounds ugly. Is anyone around who can handle working on that level for tty/ldisc/etc. fixes?
May 15 09:17:53 <viro> akpm: and that will bite
May 15 09:18:08 <wli> (besides you)
May 15 09:18:30 <viro> folks, that's #kernel stuff, IMO
May 15 09:18:40 <wli> okay

May 15 09:21:12 <akpm> yup
May 15 09:21:15 <rmk> can we have it specified in UTC please? 8)
May 15 09:21:25 <bzzz> yes ;)
May 15 09:21:36 <akpm> three hours earlier than this one
May 15 09:21:47 <rmk> I think most people know the offset of their local timezone from UTC, but not from PDT or some other zone.

May 15 10:00:43 <Gandalf> hensema: I'll have to check next time I reboot, all I know is that it has worked when I wanted to use it
May 15 10:00:46 <phillips> that would be a davem question
May 15 10:01:09 <hensema> Gandalf: it takes 5-8 minutes on my box
May 15 10:01:22 <-- Mercury has quit (Ping timeout: 485 seconds)
May 15 10:01:27 <phillips> personally, I'm skeptical that ipv6 matters very much

May 15 10:02:28 <Gandalf> it will take a long time until ipv6 is widespread
May 15 10:02:38 <hensema> I think the support in 2.6 should be as good as the support in 2.4, i.e. no regressions
May 15 10:02:57 <hensema> preferably better support of course ;-)
May 15 10:03:05 <Gandalf> it should be improved, new features and bugfixes has gone in

May 15 10:18:20 <phillips> because of the must-fix party

May 15 10:40:26 <phillips> hanna, that's 5 a.m. in europe or did I read it wrong?
May 15 10:41:04 * phillips read it wrong
May 15 10:41:32 <phillips> that would be 20:00 central european time I think
May 15 10:41:49 <hanna> phillips, all I know is PDT (pacific daylight time) is -7 hr from utc. so I just subtraced 7 from 11am and ended up with 4am utc time?
May 15 10:42:06 <phillips> better try adding
May 15 10:42:25 <fatal_> hanna: aren't you supposed to add 7h to get UTC?
May 15 10:42:41 <phillips> also, I'm quite unsure about how daylight savings factors into it
May 15 10:42:44 <hanna> Obviously I dont do this often, call me a dumb american...
May 15 10:43:16 <hanna> phillips daylight saving is just -7 from utc as opposed to -8 the other half of the year...
May 15 10:43:24 <davej> is it just 3 hrs earlier than this week ?
May 15 10:43:27 <hanna> fatal_:  so I should add... Ok.
May 15 10:43:32 <hanna> davej.. exactly!
May 15 10:43:35 <davej> in which case that'll be 7PM GMT
May 15 10:43:37 <phillips> hanna, quick test: which coast is vancouver on? ;)
May 15 10:43:43 <fatal_> I'm GMT+2 (Central European Time + Daylight saving (summertime)), today's talk started at 23:00 .. 21:00 GMT ... 3h earlier next week means?
May 15 10:43:44 <davej> erm.. s/GMT/BST/
May 15 10:43:46 <hanna> same as pdt philips
May 15 10:44:13 <hanna> phillips, west coast same as me and akpm are on...
May 15 10:44:32 <phillips> hanna, your geography is above average for an american
May 15 10:44:47 <phillips> granted I did give you a hint: it's on a coast
May 15 10:44:53 <hanna> haha... Ive driven to vancouver it is a great city
