<sect2><title>Perform time-domain analysis with a frame size of 512</title>
<sect3><title>Input the file, play it back and state what the spoken phrase is</title>
<para>
The spoken phrase is "Human Computer Communication".
</para>

<sect3><title>Compute the energy contour in dB</title>
<para>
The following Matlab script was used to generate the energy contour in dB, including using the first frame as a reference of 0 dB.
</para>

<execute><cmd>code2db</cmd><input>econtour.m</input></execute>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Compute the normalised autocorrelation contour</title>
<para>
The following Matlab script was used to calculate the autocorrelation contour:
</para>

<execute><cmd>code2db</cmd><input>autocorr.m</input></execute>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Set a suitable autocorrelation value for the voiced/unvoiced threshold and compute the fundamental frequency contour</title>
<para>
The fundamental frequency is calculated by the autocorrelation function in the code in the previous section.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Plot all three of the above contours with a common time axis and on that plot mark the phoneme boundaries and label the phonemes</title>
<para>
Please refer the to next page for this graph, with annotation.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Documentation</title>
<para>
The two scripts presented earlier in this section to calculate the values required are tied together by the following Matlab script:
</para>

<execute><cmd>code2db</cmd><input>questionOne.m</input></execute>
</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Perform frequency-domain analysis on a frame in the centre of the first vowel /u/ and on a frame in the centre of the consonant /sh/</title>
<para>
The following scripts were used to perform these calculations:
</para>

<execute><cmd>code2db</cmd><input>questionTwo.m</input></execute>
<execute><cmd>code2db</cmd><input>ph_u.m</input></execute>
<execute><cmd>code2db</cmd><input>ph_sh.m</input></execute>
<execute><cmd>code2db</cmd><input>fd_analyse.m</input></execute>
