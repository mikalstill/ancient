<h1>Speech File Content</h1>

<p>There are 3x3 files for the training of the automatic speech recognition system:</p>

<p>3 speakers: s014, s017 and s029 speak each of the digits &quot;one&quot;,
&quot;two&quot; and &quot;three&quot;. Accordingly, the 9 training files are named s014d001.mfc ... s029d003.mfc.</p>

<p>There is one test file which contains an unknown digit between &quot;one&quot; and
&quot;three&quot;, spoken by speaker s031. This file is named s031d00x.mfc and the utterance in this&nbsp; file is to be
&quot;recognised&quot; by the automatic speech recognition system.</p>

<h1>Speech File Format</h1>

<p>The files contain sets of mel-frequency cepstral coefficients ( MFCCs)
computed using the HMM Toolkit (HTK). Each file contains 1 line with 4 integer values, followed by 1 line for each frame with
11 float values.</p>

<p>The first line of the file contains the 4 values:<br>
1. the number of frames in the file<br>
2.&nbsp; the time period represented by 1 frame in units of 100ns (this is
100,000, being a period of 100,000 x 100ns = 10,000,000 ns = 0.01s)<br>
3.&nbsp; the number of bytes for each frame (this is 44, representing 11 float numbers)<br>
4. a code for&nbsp; the kind of parameters following (this is octal 14106, standing for
mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)&nbsp; and
log energy)</p>

<p>For the current application, only the number of frames in the file is of
importance for the subsequent reading of the frame vectors.</p>

<p>The following lines each contain a frame vector, comprising<br>
ten MFCCs c(1) to c(10) and the log energy.</p>
