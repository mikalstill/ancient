>I wasn't expecting much when I received my copy of <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Tuning and Customizing a Linux System</I
> to review. I had read the sole review on amazon.com, and it was very short of being complimentary. Having now actually looked at the book, I think that reviewer has completely misinterpreted the intention of the book. Part of the problem is the title of the book. Many people I suspect will read the title and think <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Ah ha! A book to help me configure product X to be able to handle more load / users / gronks per hour"</SPAN
>. This isn't what <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Tuning and Customizing a Linux System</I
> is about at all &#8212; the book is aimed at introductory to intermediate Linux users who are interested in exploring other distributions, and perhaps understanding a little more about how the operating system functions.</P
><P
>It is also worth noting that this is the first book of it's type I have seen where the author has taken the time to devote the first 25 pages of the book to attempting to explain the history of Linux, and the GNU philosophy. It's a reasonable attempt as well.</P
><P
>The book then goes on to talk about three distributions in detail: Red Hat Linux 7.3; Slackware Linux 8.0; and Debian GNU/Linux 3.0. The book discusses issues which apply to all Linux users, such as the kernel numbering conventions, the File system Hierarchy Standard (see http://www.pathname.com/fhs/ for more details), and the Linux Standards Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/).</P
><P
>As a long time Red Hat user, the chapter on Red Hat 7.3 contains very few surprises, and didn't contain any glaring inaccuracies which would cause me to wince. It also covered all the things which I would expect a new user to be told -- for instance how Red Hat goes about deciding what makes it into a given release, how to find packages, and how to install packages once you have found them. It also covers some basic configuration tasks, such as adding your own run level scripts. If you are a Red Hat power user, then there is nothing new to you here. You should also note that the book does assume that you've already managed to install the system, and don't need to be told how to do things like change directory at a shell prompt.</P
><P
>The book also covers similar details for Slackware 8.0, and Debian 3.0 Beta (the latest version which was available at the time of poublication). Again, if your a power user, then these sections are of limited use, but might serve as a good reference. If your a newer user however, they serve as a very useful introduction to your chosen distribution. Overall, Daniel L. Morril devotes 140 pages to discussions of these three distributions.</P

>Tuning and Customizing a Linux System</I
> then goes on to discuss how to install other software on your Linux system. It discusses the pros and cons of installing source downloaded from the Internet versus installing a package from your distribution vendor. It also discusses how to build source packages of various forms, as well as how to use autoconf and Makefiles. It even goes as far as describing briefly how to roll your own packages for your chosen distribution using downloaded source.</P
><P
>The next hundred or so pages of the book cover how to install several software packages: OpenSSH, Pluggable Authentication Modules, the Dante SOCKS library, Apache, CVS, and Sun's Java Development Kit.</P
><P
>Daniel L. Morril then finishes up <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Tuning and Customizing a Linux System</I
> with three case studies: how to build a desktop Linux machine; how to build a software development machine (although it doesn't match my personal beliefs about what a development machine should look like); and how to build a network firewalling machine. All of these case studies are based on Red Hat 7.3, and are little more than lists of what software you should install if you want to play MPEG movies, surf the Internet, or a variety of other common tasks. As an example, two pages are devoted to instructions on what software to install to be able to play those MPEG movies. There is also discussion of required hardware for the named task &#8212; for example installing network cards in your firewall machine. The reality is that a user is probably better off consulting a HOWTO for this sort of information.</P
><P
>In summary, this is the wrong book to go out and buy if you're expecting to be told how to install a Linux system from scratch. It is also the wrong book to buy if you're a power user looking for high end configuration and optimization tips. On the other hand, if you're new to Linux, and want some hints on how to actually use your new Linux machine once you have managed to install it, then this book is for you. It's also an acceptable reference for what packages to install to perform common tasks.</P
